OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of budesonide Turbuhaler 400 microg/day with budesonide aqua 256 microg/day in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Secondarily to ascertain patients' preferences for the two nasal devices and to assess quality of life.
DESIGN Randomized, multicentre, double-blind, double- dummy, parallel groups study.
SETTING Private practices and hospital clinics in Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba.
POPULATION Two hundred and eighty-four out-patients with SAR, who were symptomatic during the ragweed season, volunteered for enrolment (243 randomized).
RESULTS Mean daily nasal symptom scores were significantly reduced with treatment. There were no statistically significant changes from baseline for eye symptoms. Most patients (more than 80%) achieved substantial control of their symptoms with budesonide. The most common nasal and non-nasal adverse events for both groups were epistaxis and headache. Turbuhaler was easier to use and more convenient to carry, had less of an unpleasant taste, and caused less nasal irritation than the aqua spray. More than twice as many patients preferred Turbuhaler to the aqua spray (69% versus 31%). Improvement in quality of life from baseline to clinic visits was statistically significant in both groups.
CONCLUSION Once daily use of 256 mg of budesonide aqua and 400 mg of budesonide Turbuhaler are equally safe and efficacious in the treatment of SAR. Patients preferred the budesonide powder formulation delivered via Turbuhaler two to one over the aqua formulation.

10390665,"['granisetron', 'perphenazine']","Anti-emetic efficacy of prophylactic granisetron compared with perphenazine for the prevention of post-operative vomiting in children.

We have compared the efficacy of granisetron with perphenazine in the prevention of vomiting after tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy in children. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, 90 paediatric patients, ASA I, aged 4-10 years, received granisetron 40 mg kg-1 or perphenazine 70 mg kg-1 (n = 45 each) intravenously immediately after an inhalation induction of anaesthesia. A standard general anaesthetic technique was employed throughout. A complete response, defined as no emesis with no need for another rescue antiemetic, during the first 3 h (0-3 h) after anesthesia was 87% with granisetron and 78% with perphenazine (P = 0.204). The corresponding incidence during the next 21 h (3-24 h) after anaesthesia was 87% and 62% (P = 0.007). No clinically serious adverse events were observed in any of the groups. We conclude that granisetron is a better anti-emetic than perphenazine for the long-term prevention of post-operative vomiting in children undergoing general anaesthesia for tonsillectomy.

10475150,"['somatostatin ( octreotide', 'Somatostatin', 'saline', 'octreotide ( Sandostatin', 'octreotide', 'somatostatin -- in', 'octreotide -- fails']","The role of somatostatin (octreotide) in the regulation of melatonin secretion in healthy volunteers and in patients with primary hypothyroidism.

Somatostatin has been found in the pineal gland of several animal species, which suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of melatonin secretion. Whether somatostatin has regulatory influence on melatonin secretion in man has never been unequivocally shown. We studied the nocturnal melatonin secretion in 8 healthy volunteers, and 6 women with untreated primary hypothyroidism, a disease state that is associated with increased nocturnal secretion of melatonin. The participants were given subcutaneous injections at 18:00 h and 23:00 h of either saline or octreotide (Sandostatin; each injection 50 microg). During the nights when the healthy volunteers were given octreotide, melatonin secretion was similar to that recorded during administration of saline. Also the urinary excretion of melatonin was of similar magnitude at these two occasions. By contrast, the GH secretion was significantly lower the nights the healthy controls were given octreotide (GH AUC 22.6+/-5.4 mU/l x h during octreotide and 126.6+/-21.9 mU/l x h during saline; p<0.01). The patients with hypothyroidism also showed similar nocturnal melatonin secretion during octreotide and saline. Urinary excretion of melatonin also remained unchanged, as did GH secretion. The total nocturnal secretion of TSH was, however, significantly reduced by octreotide (TSH AUC 562+/-136 mU/l x h during octreotide and 851+/-185 mU/l x h during saline; p<0.05), thus suggesting that 100 microg of octreotide should be sufficient to inhibit also the pinealocytes if their function were regulated by somatostatin. Since exogenous somatostatin--in the form of octreotide--fails to influence nocturnal secretion and urinary excretion of melatonin in normal subjects and in patients with primary hypothyroidism, it is reasonable to assume that endogenous somatostatin may not be an important regulator of melatonin secretion in man.

10578479,"['soy', 'normal diet', 'soy beverage']","Effects of soy intake on sex hormone metabolism in premenopausal women.

Studies suggest that phytoestrogens in soy products may impart hormonal effects that protect women against breast cancer. Limited research suggests that intake of soy products high in isoflavonoid phytoestrogens affects sex hormone metabolism, but it is unknown whether phytoestrogens in soy have any effect on menstrual function or serum sex hormones in women on common hormone therapies, such as oral contraceptives (OC). We studied the effects of soy in 36 premenopausal women, 20 of whom used OC. Subjects consumed their normal diet for two menstrual cycles and added a soy beverage containing 20 g of protein and 38 mg of total isoflavones to their usual diet for another two menstrual cycles. No significant differences were observed in serum estrone, estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, prolactin, or progesterone concentrations with soy feeding in the non-OC or the OC group. No changes in menstrual cycle length or the urinary estrogen metabolite ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone to 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone were seen with soy feeding in the non-OC or the OC group. Levels of urinary estrogen metabolites were significantly different between the non-OC and the OC group. Thus soy consumption had no significant effect on the menstrual cycle, serum sex hormones, or urinary estrogen metabolite ratio in premenopausal OC or non-OC users.

Although root instrumentation has been accepted as the most important cause-related treatment of periodontal diseases, repeated scaling and root planing may over time result in substantive loss of tooth substance and increased sensitivity of the teeth. In an effort to minimize these side effects of therapy, non-root substance removing curettes have been developed. However, the clinical effects of such plastic curettes with regard to the control of the periodontal infection has not yet been established. The aims of this study were, therefore, to compare the effects of root instrumentation using plastic curettes (Universal Perio Soft Scaler, Hawe-Neos Dental, Bioggio, TI, Switzerland) versus conventional steel curettes on the periodontal conditions during supportive periodontal therapy. 40 subjects participated in this parallel, randomized, double blind, prospective longitudinal clinical study following active peridontal therapy. 20 subjects served as a control group and were treated with conventional steel curettes during a supportive periodontal care visit (SPT). The other 20 subjects, the experimental group, were treated using plastic curettes during a similar SPT visit. Clinical parameters, such as bleeding on probing (BOP) and probing pocket depth (PPD), were assessed at baseline and 3-6 months later at the next regular SPT visit. In addition, the BOP percentage was determined 10 days following baseline. The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment modalities regarding BOP and PPD at any observation time. Both treatments were effective in reducing the BOP percentage which ranged from 17-42% at baseline by about 40% after 10 days (mean BOP baseline: 26%, mean BOP after 10 days: 16%). This clinical study suggests that non-root substance removing curettes may be valuable instruments for periodontally treated patients during maintenance care, thus minimizing trauma on the hard structures of the teeth.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was the examination of efficacy and tolerability of an application-form of the new combination of Xylometazoline with Dexpanthenol (Nasic) versus Xylometazoline alone.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Randomized verum controlled parallel-group-comparison of two weeks treatment of a nasal-spray. 61 inpatients with the diagnosis Rhinitis following nasal operation were included in this study and 30 patients were treated with verum and placebo each. The assessment of nasal-breathing-resistance according to scores was defined as target-parameter. Confirmatory statistical analysis was carried out according to Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-U two-sided at alpha < or = 0.05.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The superiority of the combination of Xylometazoline-Dexpanthenol nasal-spray versus Xylometazoline nasal spray could be proven for the target-parameter as clinically relevant and statistically significant. The clinically proven efficacy is emphasized by good tolerability of both treatments. Due to easy handling of the nasal-spray a good compliance was confirmed.
CONCLUSION Distinct improvement of symptoms in patients following nasal operations underlines the efficacy of both medications. With respect to the tolerability therapy with the combination is more beneficial in comparison to the alternative therapy. The result of this controlled clinical study confirms that the combination Xylometazoline-Dexpanthenol is an enlargement and improvement of effective medicinal treatment of rhinitis following nasal operation in comparison to therapy with Xylometazoline alone.

10764172,['morphine'],"Intrathecal morphine suppresses NK cell activity following abdominal surgery.

PURPOSE The effects of morphine on natural killer (NK) cell activity were investigated in patients who underwent hysterectomy.
METHODS Forty patients were divided into four groups of ten. The groups received intrathecal 0.5 mg morphine (Group IT0.5), intrathecal 0.1 mg morphine (Group IT0.1) or 10 mg morphine i.v. (Group IV). The remaining ten patients served as controls and received inhalation anesthesia alone (Group C). Blood samples were withdrawn before and two hours after surgery and on postoperative days one and two to determine the blood NK cell activity using a chromium release assay with K562 cells as targets, plasma catecholamines and cortisol levels. The postoperative pain score and side effects were studied in the four groups.
RESULTS In Group IT0.5, the NK cell activity was lower on postoperative day 1 (23.9 +/- 8.4%) than the baseline level (45.7 +/- 13%) before surgery, and recovered on postoperative day 2. In Groups IT0.1, C and IV, the NK cell activities showed no significant changes. In all four groups, neither plasma adrenaline nor noradrenaline concentrations changed. In all four groups, the plasma cortisol levels increased after surgery, on postoperative days 1 and 2. The pain score was lower two hours after surgery and on postoperative day 1 in Group IT0.5 than in the other groups.
CONCLUSION These results suggest that long-lasting analgesic effects of intrathecal 0.5 mg morphine suppress the immune response following abdominal surgery.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may affect blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive patients receiving drug treatment, but data on the effects of low-dose aspirin are scanty. This study assessed the effects of chronic treatment with low doses of aspirin (100 mg/day) on clinic and ambulatory systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP in hypertensives on chronic, stable antihypertensive therapy. The study was conducted in the framework of the Primary Prevention Project (PPP), a randomized, controlled factorial trial on the preventive effect of aspirin or vitamin E in people with one or more cardiovascular risk factors. Fifteen Italian hypertension units studied 142 hypertensive patients (76 men, 66 women; mean age 59 +/- 5.9 years) treated with different antihypertensive drugs: 71 patients were randomized to aspirin and 71 served as controls. All patients underwent a clinic BP evaluation with an automatic sphygmomanometer and a 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, at baseline and after 3 months of aspirin treatment. At the end of the study the changes in clinic SBP and DBP were not statistically different in treated and untreated subjects. Ambulatory SBP and DBP after 3 months of aspirin treatment were similar to baseline: deltaSBP -0.5 mmHg (95% confidence intervals [CI] from -1.9 to +2.9 mm Hg) and deltaDBP -1.1 mm Hg (95% CI from -2.5 to +0.3 mm Hg). The pattern was similar in the control group. No interaction was found between aspirin and the most used antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists). Despite the relatively small sample size our results seem to exclude any significant influence of low-dose aspirin on BP control in hypertensives under treatment.

Young children with pervasive developmental disorder were randomly assigned to intensive treatment or parent training. The intensive treatment group (7 with autism, 8 with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified--NOS) averaged 24.52 hours per week of individual treatment for one year, gradually reducing hours over the next 1 to 2 years. The parent training group (7 with autism, 6 with pervasive developmental disorder NOS) received 3 to 9 months of parent training. The groups appeared similar at intake on all measures; however, at follow-up the intensive treatment group outperformed the parent training group on measures of intelligence, visual-spatial skills, language, and academics, though not adaptive functioning or behavior problems. Children with pervasive developmental disorder NOS may have gained more than those with autism.

A series of randomized, controlled, masked field studies was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of selamectin in the treatment of flea infestations on dogs and cats, and in the prevention of heartworm infection in dogs. In addition, observations were made on the beneficial effect of selamectin treatment on dogs and cats showing signs of flea allergy dermatitis (FAD). In all studies selamectin was applied topically, once per month, in unit doses providing a minimum dosage of 6mgkg(-1). Dogs and cats with naturally occurring flea infestations, some of which also had signs associated with FAD, were assigned randomly to receive three months of topical treatment with selamectin (220 dogs, 189 cats) or a positive-control product (dogs: fenthion, n=81; cats: pyrethrins, n=66). Selamectin was administered on days 0, 30, and 60. Day 0 was defined as the day that the animal first received treatment. Flea burdens were assessed by flea comb counts and clinical evaluations of FAD were performed before treatment, and on days 14, 30, 60, and 90. On days 30, 60, and 90, mean flea counts in selamectin-treated dogs were reduced by 92.1, 99.0, and 99.8%, and mean flea counts in fenthion-treated dogs were reduced by 81.5, 86.8, and 86.1%, respectively, compared with day 0 counts. Also, on days 30, 60, and 90, mean flea counts in selamectin-treated cats were reduced by 92.5, 98.3, and 99.3%, and mean flea counts in pyrethrin-treated cats were reduced by 66.4, 73.9, and 81.3%, respectively, compared with day 0 counts. Selamectin also was beneficial in alleviating signs in dogs and cats diagnosed clinically with FAD. A total of 397 dogs free of adult heartworm infection from four heartworm-endemic areas of the USA were allocated randomly to six months of treatment with selamectin (n=298) or ivermectin (n=99). Selamectin achieved a heartworm prevention rate of 100%, with all dogs testing negative for microfilariae and adult heartworm antigen on days 180 and 300. Selamectin was administered to a total of 673 dogs and 347 cats having an age range of 6 weeks to 19 years (3954 doses). The animals included 19 purebred or crossbred Collies (Bearded, Border, and unspecified). There were no serious adverse events. Results of these studies indicated that selamectin was highly effective in the control of flea infestations in dogs and cats without the need for simultaneous treatment of the environment or of in-contact animals and also was beneficial in alleviating signs associated with FAD. Selamectin also was 100% effective in preventing the development of canine heartworms and was safe for topical use in dogs and cats.

11099086,"['ciprofloxacin', 'ceftriaxone']","Oral ciprofloxacin vs. intramuscular ceftriaxone as empiric treatment of acute invasive diarrhea in children.

BACKGROUND Acute invasive diarrhea is a potentially serious condition in children. Because of the increasing resistance of enteric pathogens to commonly used oral antibiotics, intramuscular ceftriaxone has become the routine drug in the treatment of acute invasive diarrhea requiring an emergency visit in southern Israel. The inconvenience of this parenteral regimen created an increased need for oral pediatric formulations for the treatment of invasive diarrhea.
OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a suspension formulation of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute invasive diarrhea in infants and children.
PATIENTS AND METHODS From July 1996 through December 1997, 201 evaluable children ages 6 months to 10 years (35% <1 year; 70% <3 years) presenting with acute invasive diarrhea at the Pediatric Emergency Room were randomized to receive either ciprofloxacin suspension (10 mg/kg twice a day + im placebo; n = 95) or im ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/day + placebo suspension; n = 106) for 3 days in a double blind manner. Stool cultures for Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter spp. and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli were obtained on Days 1, 3, 4 to 5 and 21 +/- 5. Clinical response and safety were assessed on Days 1, 2, 3, 4 to 5 and 21 +/- 5.
RESULTS We isolated 127 pathogens from 121 (60%) patients: 73 (57%) Shigella; 23 (18%) Salmonella; 18 (14%) E. coli; and 13 (10%) Campylobacter. Overall bacteriologic eradication on Day 4 to 5 was 99% for Shigella, 77% for Salmonella and 77% for Campylobacter, with no difference between the 2 groups. Clinical cure or improvement was observed in 100 and 99% of the ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone groups, respectively. Serum ciprofloxacin values determined on Day 3 of the treatment were higher in the majority of patients than were the MIC50 and MIC90 values for the Shigella and Salmonella spp. isolated. Possible drug-related adverse events occurred in 13 patients [ciprofloxacin, 8 (8%); ceftriaxone, 5 (4.7%)] and were mild and transient. Joint examination was normal during and after completion of therapy in all patients.
CONCLUSION Oral ciprofloxacin was as safe and effective as intramuscular ceftriaxone for the empiric treatment of acute invasive diarrhea in ambulatory pediatric patients requiring an emergency room visit.

SUMMARY The effect of garlic and onion on alimentary hyperlipemia, induced by feeding 100 g butter, has been studied in 10 healthy subjects. The freshly extracted juice of 50 g of garlic or onion, as well as an equivalent amount of their ether-extracted essential oils, was administered randomly on four different days during a one-week period. Garlic and onion have a significant protective action against fat-induced increases in serum cholesterol and plasma fibrinogen and decreases in coagulation time and fibrinolytic activity. The essential oil fraction, which contains all the taste and odour, exactly duplicated the beneficial effects of whole garlic and onion. It is, therefore, concluded that the active principle of garlic and onion is the essential oil, which chemically is a combination of sulphur-containing compounds, mainly allyl propyl disulphide and diallyl disulphide.

OBJECTIVES To estimate cost and outcomes of the Arthritis Foundation aquatic exercise classes from the societal perspective.
DESIGN Randomized trial of 20-week aquatic classes. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was estimated using trial data. Sample size was based on 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the cost/QALY gained would not exceed $50,000.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS Recruited 249 adults from Washington State aged 55 to 75 with a doctor-confirmed diagnosis of osteoarthritis to participate in aquatic classes. The Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB) and Current Health Desirability Rating (CHDR) were used for economic evaluation, supplemented by the arthritis-specific Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and Perceived Quality of Life Scale (PQOL) collected at baseline and postclass. Outcome results applied to life expectancy tables were used to estimate QALYs. Use of health care facilities was assessed from diaries/questionnaires and Medicare reimbursement rates used to estimate costs. Nonparametric bootstrap sampling of costs/QALY ratios established the 95% CI around the estimates.
RESULTS Aquatic exercisers reported equal (QWB) or better (CHDR, HAQ, PQOL) health-related quality of life compared with controls. Outcomes improved with regular class attendance. Costs/QALY gained discounted at 3% were $205,186 using the QWB and $32,643 using the CHRD.
CONCLUSION Aquatic exercise exceeded $50,000 per QALY gained using the community-weighted outcome but fell below this arbitrary budget constraint when using the participant-weighted measure. Confidence intervals around these ratios suggested wide variability of cost effectiveness of aquatic exercise.

PURPOSE To evaluate the effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) of switching from timolol to latanoprost or adding latanoprost to timolol in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension where IOP is not adequately controlled with timolol.
METHODS This was a 6-week, double-masked, randomised multi-centre study. 53 patients with primary open angle glaucoma, capsular glaucoma, or ocular hypertension with an IOP of at least 21 mmHg on current therapy were recruited. After a run-in period of at least 2 weeks on timolol, 5 mg/ml twice daily, patients were randomised to one of three groups. One group continued on timolol, one switched from timolol to latanoprost, 50 microg/ml once daily, and a third group received latanoprost in addition to timolol. The efficacy was evaluated by comparing IOP at 9 AM at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment.
RESULTS IOP at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment (mean +/- SEM) were 24.2 +/- 0.9 and 23.8 +/- 1.0 mmHg (n = 16) for patients continuing on timolol, 26.3 +/- 1.2 and 19.6 +/- 1.1 mmHg (n = 17) for patients switching to latanoprost, and 23.2 +/- 1.0 and 17.5 +/- 0.8 mmHg (n = 17) for patients with combined treatment. Adding latanoprost to timolol reduced IOP with 5.9 +/- 0.9 mmHg (p < 0.001) and switching from timolol to latanoprost reduced IOP with 5.0 +/- 0.9 mmHg (p < 0.001), which caused in each group a significant IOP reduction of about 25%.
CONCLUSIONS The effect of latanoprost was additive to that of timolol, and a good effect on IOP reduction was also achieved by switching from timolol to latanoprost, suggesting that a switch in many patients is an effective alternative to combination treatment.

PURPOSE To compare the efficacy and safety of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) and topotecan in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma that recurred after or didn't respond to first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with measurable and assessable disease were randomized to receive either PLD 50 mg/m(2) as a 1-hour infusion every 4 weeks or topotecan 1.5 mg/m(2)/d for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks. Patients were stratified prospectively for platinum sensitivity and for the presence or absence of bulky disease.
RESULTS A total of 474 patients were treated (239 PLD and 235 topotecan). They comprised the intent-to-treat population. The overall progression-free survival rates were similar between the two arms (P =.095). The overall response rates for PLD and topotecan were 19.7% and 17.0%, respectively (P =.390). Median overall survival times were 60 weeks for PLD and 56.7 weeks for topotecan. Data analyzed in platinum-sensitive patients demonstrated a statistically significant benefit from PLD for progression-free survival (P =.037), with medians of 28.9 for PLD versus 23.3 weeks for topotecan. For overall survival, PLD was significantly superior to topotecan (P =.008), with a median of 108 weeks versus 71.1 weeks. The platinum-refractory subgroup demonstrated a nonstatistically significant survival trend in favor of topotecan (P =.455). Severe hematologic toxicity was more common with topotecan and was more likely to be associated with dosage modification, or growth factor or blood product utilization.
CONCLUSION The comparable efficacy, favorable safety profile, and convenient dosing support the role of PLD as a valuable treatment option in this patient population.

Women who smoke and take oral contraceptives (OCs) have significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but the exact mechanismsfor the increased risk are not known. Cardiovascular reactivity to psychological stress may be one mechanism for the enhanced risk, but the small number of studies examining whether OC users who smoke have greater reactivity have produced mixed results. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of chronic cigarette smoking, acute nicotine administration, and OC use on cardiovascular and lipid reactivity. Sixty healthy women, half of whom had been using OCs for at least the previous 6 months, participated in the study. Approximately two thirds were smokers and were randomized to be tested after either a 12-hr nicotine deprivation or administration of nicotine gum. One third were nonsmokers. Heart rate, blood pressure, and lipid measures were taken at rest, during a videotaped speech task, and during recovery from the task. Results indicated that, among OC nonusers, there was no effect of smoking status or nicotine administration on cardiovascular reactivity. However, among OC users, nonsmokers had significantly greater heart rate and diastolic blood pressure reactivity to stress. These data show that acute nicotine administration, in the form of nicotine gum, has no effect on cardiovascular or lipid stress reactivity in women. However OC use among nonsmoking women is associated with greater cardiovascular reactivity to stress.

Left ventricular systolic function was measured by echocardiography on day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28; arrhythmia was analysed at Holter monitoring in day 1 and 2 of MI.
RESULTS TLT failed to arrest progression of left ventricular dilation by the end of the hospital stay. Patients given neoton in acute period of MI had no increase in the end systolic and diastolic volumes of the left ventricle in the course of the first months after MI onset. Antiarrhythmic action of neoton manifested on MI day 2.
CONCLUSION Neoton given to MI patients receiving TLT prevents progression of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and establishment of predictors of unfavourable outcome.

The effects of 12 weeks of antioxidant supplementation on exercise-induced oxidative stress were investigated in older adults (60 (SE 1) years; BMI 26 (SE 1) kg/m(2)). Subjects were randomly divided in two groups: supplementation (n 11) with 100 mg dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, 200 mg ascorbic acid, and 2 mg beta-carotene, and placebo (n 9). Before and after the 12 week supplementation period, subjects cycled for 45 min at submaximal intensity (50 % maximal workload capacity). Antipyrine was used as marker for oxidative stress. Antipyrine reacts quickly with hydroxyl radicals to form para- and ortho-hydroxyantipyrine. The latter metabolite is not formed in man through the mono-oxygenase pathway of cytochrome P450. Daily supplementation significantly increased plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene in the supplemented group (Delta 14.4 (SE 3.2) and 0.4 (se 0.1) micromol/l; P<0.001 and P<0.01). No significant differences, within and between groups, were observed in the exercise-induced increase in the ratios para- and ortho-hydroxyantipyrine to antipyrine. In addition, supplementation did not affect the exercise-induced increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in plasma.

11750293,['standard outpatient clinic treatment'],"The course of depression in recent onset rheumatoid arthritis: the predictive role of disability, illness perceptions, pain and coping.

BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the course of depression for patients with recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to investigate predictors of depression.
METHODS Twenty-two patients with a history of recently diagnosed RA of less than 2 years were assessed on a variety of clinical outcome and process measures on six assessment occasions over a 21-month period. These 22 patients constituted the control group of a controlled trial and received standard outpatient clinic treatment during follow-up.
RESULTS Patients became significantly more depressed over time. A set of five factors were found to consistently predict depression at the following assessment. These were initial level of depression, disability, pain, beliefs about the consequences of arthritis and coping strategies.
CONCLUSIONS The results confirm the importance of psychological factors in early RA and their relative independence from physical findings. This is the first study to document the importance of illness perceptions in recent onset RA.

Eighteen patients who had undergone stoma surgery were assessed with respect to their anxiety level and self-reported quality of life (QoL) on three occasions; namely, immediately after surgery, 5 weeks after surgery, and 10 weeks after surgery. The patients were randomised into a control group (n = 10) and an experimental group (n = 8). A 20-min set of audiotaped instructions on progressive muscle relaxation training (PMRT) was given to the patients in the experimental group for home practice. Assessment instructions included the Chinese State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (C-STAI), the Quality of Life Index for Colostomy (QoL-Colostomy) and the Hong Kong Chinese version of the World Health Organisation Quality of Life Scale (WHOQoL). Results indicated that there was a significant decrease in both the C-STAI score (F = 4.66, P < 0.05) and the WHOQoL score (F = 4.74, P < 0.05) in the experimental group. Among the domains of WHOQoL, a significant difference was shown in physical health/independence and general perception of QoL, with the experimental group demonstrating better functioning. For the QoL-Colostomy, however, there was no significant difference between the control and experimental groups. The results suggest that the use of PMRT could enhance quality of life and decrease state anxiety in patients after stoma surgery.

We investigated whether 5 to 20mg per week oral methotrexate could slow down disease progression in 44 patients with inclusion body myositis in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study over 48 weeks. Mean change of quantitative muscle strength testing sum scores was the primary study outcome measure. Quantitative muscle strength testing sum scores declined in both treatment groups, -0.2% for methotrexate and -3.4% for placebo (95% confidence interval = -2.5% to +9.1% for difference). There were also no differences in manual muscle testing sum scores, activity scale scores and patients' own assessments after 48 weeks of treatment. Serum creatine kinase activity decreased significantly in the methotrexate group. We conclude that oral methotrexate did not slow down progression of muscle weakness but decreased serum creatine kinase activity.

OBJECTIVE To observe the therapeutic effects of limbal epithelial autograft transplantation and pterygium excision in the treatment of pterygium.
METHODS A prospective randomized paired-eye trial was studied. There were 208 patients (229 eyes) with initial pterygium, and they were allocated to two groups: excision of pterygium with limbal epithelial autograft transplantation surgery (A group, 106 cases and 124 eyes) and simple pterygium excision (B group, 102 cases and 105 eyes). The criteria for recovery were corneal transparency with stable epithelial healing and no abnormal proliferation of pterygium-like tissue. The post-operative follow-up periods ranged from 18 approximately 28 (22.4 +/- 4.9) months.
RESULTS Some of the patients lost follow-up. In the eyes followed up, 5 of 11 2 eyes (4.5%) in A group and 41 of 96 eyes (42.7%) in B group were recurred, the difference being very significant (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION To provide a new stem cell source, limbal epithelial autograft transplantation, for an injured limb us is a reasonable therapeutic method for the treatment of pterygium.

The aim of the present study was to assess the level of accuracy for measurements of intra-ocular pressure (IOP) obtained with a new non-contact tonometer (NCT) the Reichert AT550. Measurements were compared against those obtained with the Reichert Xpert Plus, Goldmann applanation tonometer and Perkins tonometer. Thirty-five university students were assessed with the four tonometers in a randomised order, with non-contact tonometry performed first. Each of the four measurement devices had its own trained clinical observer. Plots of differences of IOP as a function of the mean for each pair of instruments were obtained. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the AT550 NCT with contact applanation tonometry (AT) (p> 0.05), displaying the closest level of agreement (as represented by the lowest mean difference and the narrowest confidence interval) with the Goldmann tonometer (limits of agreement, 0.12+/-2.17). In conclusion, readings of IOP with the AT550 NCT are clinically comparable with those obtained with Goldmann tonometry in a population with IOP within the normal range.

PURPOSE Internal stenting is an integral part of endopyelotomy. Studies in animals show good healing after 1 to 2 weeks of ureterotomy. Inherent stent related problems warrant a minimum possible duration of stenting without compromising the results of endopyelotomy. We performed a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the optimum duration of stenting after endopyelotomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 57 consecutive patients with primary ureteropelvic junction obstruction were randomized to undergo 7/14Fr internal endopyelotomy stent placement for 2 (group 1) and 4 (group 2) weeks. A symptom based questionnaire was administered to all patients at stent removal. Followup was done with diuretic scanning at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and then yearly, and thereafter with diuretic renography.
RESULTS In each group 26 patients were available for evaluation. The 2 groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, symptoms and ipsilateral glomerular filtration rate. Mean followup was 22.3 (range 12 to 36) and 21.3 months (range 12 to 35) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. At the end of 1 year 24 group 1 (92.3%) and 23 group 2 (90.3%) patients had an improved drainage pattern. This difference was not significant. Stent related symptoms were present in a good proportion of patients in groups 1 and 2 but there was a significant difference in the incidence of urinary tract infections (11.5% versus 38.1%, p = 0.04). Of the group 2 patients 64% preferred 2 weeks of stenting.
CONCLUSIONS Two weeks seems to be a sufficient duration to allow functional restoration across the ureteropelvic junction after endopyelotomy and decrease stent related complications.

PURPOSE Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a radiosensitive and chemosensitive tumor. This randomized phase III trial compared concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) versus radiotherapy (RT) alone in patients with advanced NPC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS From December 1993 to April 1999, 284 patients with 1992 American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III to IV (M0) NPC were randomly allocated into two arms. Similar dosage and fractionation of RT was administered in both arms. The investigational arm received two cycles of concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin 20 mg/m(2)/d plus fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2)/d by 96-hour continuous infusion during the weeks 1 and 5 of RT. Survival analysis was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test.
RESULTS Baseline patient characteristics were comparable in both arms. After a median follow-up of 65 months, 26.2% (37 of 141) and 46.2% (66 of 143) of patients developed tumor relapse in the CCRT and RT-alone groups, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rates were 72.3% for the CCRT arm and 54.2% for the RT-only arm (P =.0022). The 5-year progression-free survival rates were 71.6% for the CCRT group compared with 53.0% for the RT-only group (P =.0012). Although significantly more toxicity was noted in the CCRT arm, including leukopenia and emesis, compliance with the combined treatment was good. The second cycle of concurrent chemotherapy was refused by nine patients and was delayed for > or = 1 week for another nine patients. There were no treatment-related deaths in either arm.
CONCLUSION We conclude that CCRT is superior to RT alone for patients with advanced NPC in endemic areas.

In people with diabetes, renal disease tends to progress from microalbuminuria to clinical proteinuria to renal insufficiency. Little evidence has been published for the nondiabetic population. This study retrospectively analyzed changes of proteinuria over 4.5 yr in the HOPE (Heart Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation) study, which compared ramipril's effects to placebo in 9297 participants, including 3577 with diabetes and 1956 with microalbuminuria. This report is restricted to 7674 participants with albuminuria data at baseline and at follow-up. Inclusion criteria were known vascular disease or diabetes plus one other cardiovascular risk factor, exclusion criteria included heart failure or known impaired left ventricular function, dipstick-positive proteinuria (>1+), and serum creatinine >2.3 mg/dl (200 microM). Baseline microalbuminuria predicted subsequent clinical proteinuria for the study participants overall (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 17.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.6 to 24.4), in participants without diabetes (OR, 16.7; 95% CI, 8.6 to 32.4), and in participants with diabetes (OR, 18.2; 95% CI, 12.4 to 26.7). Any progression of albuminuria (defined as new microalbuminuria or new clinical proteinuria) occurred in 1859 participants; 1542 developed new microalbuminuria, and 317 participants developed clinical proteinuria. Ramipril reduced the risk for any progression (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97; P = 0.0146). People without and with diabetes who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease are also at risk for a progressive rise in albuminuria. Microalbuminuria itself predicts clinical proteinuria in nondiabetic and in diabetic people. Ramipril prevents or delays the progression of albuminuria.

BACKGROUND This study tested the hypothesis that, for colonoscopy, analgesia/sedation with remifentanil and propofol might be more effective compared with anesthesia by intravenous administration of midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol.
METHODS In a prospective, randomized trial, 100 adult patients received either conscious analgesia/sedation (Sedation group) or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA group). Analgesia/sedation was achieved by infusion of remifentanil (0.20 to 0.25 microg/kg/min) and propofol in titrated doses. TIVA was induced by intravenous administration of fentanyl (2 microg/kg), midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) and propofol (dosage titrated). Cardiorespiratory parameters and bispectral index were monitored and recorded. The quality of the analgesia was assessed with a Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NRS); recovery level and return of psychomotor efficiency were evaluated with, respectively, the Aldrete scale and a Modified Post Anesthesia Discharge Scoring (MPADS) system.
RESULTS Both groups of 50 patients were comparable with respect to demographic data, initial parameters, and duration of colonoscopy. All patients in the TIVA group found the colonoscopy painless (NRS score 0). In the Sedation group, the average pain intensity score was 0.4 (0.8). There was a marked difference between the Sedation and TIVA groups with respect to the time from the end of the procedure until the maximum MPADS score was reached: respectively, -6.9 (4.0) versus 25.7 (8.4) minutes (p < 0.001). In the TIVA group, changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate and signs of respiratory depression were significant (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS Combined administration of remifentanil and propofol for colonoscopy provides sufficient analgesia, satisfactory hemodynamic stability, minor respiratory depression, and rapid recovery, and allows patients to be discharged approximately 15 minutes after the procedure.

Twenty-nine IDDM patients with borderline hypertension were randomly allocated to placebo or nitrendipine treatment. Nitrendipine was given orally at a dosage of 20 mg once daily over 4 weeks. Stimulated platelet thromboxane formation at rest and after standardized, non exhausting exercise was measured by standard methods. In addition, plasma levels of platelet factor 4 and aggregation responses to collagen and ADP were determined. In the treatment group thromboxane formation after stimulation with collagen (0.3 and 1.0 micrograms/ml) and 1 mM arachidonic acid (AA) was reduced in the resting state. Exercise induced change of thromboxane synthesis in response to 1.0 micrograms/ml collagen was significantly lower as compared to placebo (p < 0.05). In parallel, PF4 plasma levels were significantly lowered (p < 0.05). Whole blood aggregation after collagen stimulation (1.0 micrograms/ml) was reduced after 4 weeks of nitrendipine treatment, but ADP (5 microM) induced aggregation was not. These effects of nitrendipine were not seen in platelet rich plasma. In conclusion long-term nitrendipine treatment may inhibit collagen dependent platelet activation in the blood of diabetic patients with borderline hypertension.

12960652,['Epigastric impedance'],"Gastric dysrhythmia in infants with gastrointestinal diseases measured by epigastric impedance.

BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in association with myoelectrical dysrhythmia, where different types of gastric electrical activity have been described. These types of gastric myoelectrical activity and dysrhythmia can be measured by electrogastrography using cutaneous electrodes. Epigastric impedance is a non-invasive method used to study gastric emptying time and gastric phasic activity. At present no study of gastric dysrhythmia, measured with epigastric impedance, has been presented, and the purpose of the present study was to investigate gastric rhythms by means of impedance gastrography in control infants, compared to infants with different gastrointestinal diseases, before and after treatment of their disease.
METHOD 21 patients (age 0-2 months) and 40 healthy infants (age 0-2 months) were investigated. The patients suffered from partial or total intestinal obstruction, necrotizing enterocolitis or pyloric stenosis.All infants were fasting and studied during periods of at least one hour. The patients were examined in the acute state and after treatment when possible.
RESULTS A pathologic result was found in 90% of the patients. A persistent phasic activity pattern was found in 19 of the 21 patients, high frequency phasic activity in 11 of the 21 patients. Short-term phasic activity was only found in 13 out of 40 of the normal infants (32.5%).
CONCLUSION Using epigastric impedance we found that infants with partial or total intestinal obstruction had gastric phasic activity, which was not found in the control infants. The origin of the gastric phasic activity patterns is unknown, but they may be related to electrical control activity.

BACKGROUND We have continued to monitor the survival of patients randomised in a previously reported multicentre phase III study of topotecan versus paclitaxel in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer who had failed one prior platinum-based regimen.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with bidimensionally measurable disease were randomised to topotecan (1.5 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)/day as a 3-h infusion) every 21 days. Patients were eligible for treatment with the alternate therapy at third line. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC QOL)-C30 questionnaire was also used to measure eight symptoms at baseline and during each course (pain, anorexia, diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, constipation and insomnia).
RESULTS A total of 226 patients were evaluable for response. Demographic characteristics were similar in both treatment groups, as were results of the EORTC QOL-30 questionnaire. For the topotecan group, median time to progression was 18.9 weeks (range <1 to 92.6+ weeks; 25% censored), and, for paclitaxel, 14.7 weeks (range <1 to 137.3+ weeks; 12.3% censored); P = 0.076. At 4 years post-randomisation, median survival in the topotecan group was 63.0 weeks (range <1 to 238.4+ weeks; 20.5% censored) and, for paclitaxel, 53.0 weeks (range <1 to 226.3+ weeks; 12.3% censored); P = 0.44.
CONCLUSION Topotecan continues to demonstrate comparable efficacy and survival to paclitaxel with manageable and non-cumulative haematological toxicity. Non-haematological toxicity was generally mild for both groups. The long-term survival rate indicates substantial therapeutic benefit for this group of patients receiving topotecan at relapse of ovarian cancer.

OBJECTIVE The ability of the potent cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor torcetrapib (CP-529,414) to raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in healthy young subjects was tested in this initial phase 1 multidose study.
METHODS AND RESULTS Five groups of 8 subjects each were randomized to placebo (n=2) or torcetrapib (n=6) at 10, 30, 60, and 120 mg daily and 120 mg twice daily for 14 days. Torcetrapib was well tolerated, with all treated subjects completing the study. The correlation of plasma drug levels with inhibition (EC50=43 nM) was as expected based on in vitro potency (IC50 approximately 50 nM), and increases in CETP mass were consistent with the proposed mechanism of inhibition. CETP inhibition increased with escalating dose, leading to elevations of HDL-C of 16% to 91%. Total plasma cholesterol did not change significantly because of a reduction in nonHDL-C, including a 21% to 42% lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at the higher doses. Apolipoprotein A-I and E were elevated 27% and 66%, respectively, and apoB was reduced 26% with 120 mg twice daily. Cholesteryl ester content decreased and triglyceride increased in the nonHDL plasma fraction, with contrasting changes occurring in HDL.
CONCLUSIONS These effects of CETP inhibition resemble those observed in partial CETP deficiency. This work serves as a prelude to further studies in subjects with low HDL, or combinations of dyslipidemia, in assessing the role of CETP in atherosclerosis.

The objectives of this study were to update the analyses of each individual trial and to analyze prognostic factors and treatment effects based on pooled data.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Survival and disease status were updated to April 2001. Analysis of prognostic factors using optimized statistical models was based on data from patients in E1684, E1690, E1694, and E2696. Analysis of treatment effects versus observation (Obs) was based on data from 713 patients randomized to high-dose IFN-alpha 2b (HDI) or Obs in Trials E1684 and E1690.
RESULTS Updated analysis of E1684, E1690, and E1694 confirmed their original conclusions, now at median follow-up intervals of 2.1-12.6 years. Based on two-sided univariate log-rank analysis of pooled data from E1684 and E1690 (median follow-up, 7.2 years), relapse-free survival (RFS)-but not overall survival (OS)-was significantly prolonged (two-sided log-rank P value = 0.006) for patients treated with HDI versus Obs. Among all patients, prognostic factors that significantly negatively impacted RFS and OS included ulceration, recurrent disease at entry, enrollment in E1684, and age > 49 years. Multivariate statistical models adjusting for these factors confirmed the statistically significant RFS benefit of HDI versus Obs but did not demonstrate a significant OS benefit in the pooled populations.
CONCLUSIONS In patients with high-risk resected melanoma, HDI is effective adjuvant therapy with strong evidence for improved RFS and evidence for moderate improvement in OS based on two prospective randomized studies but not the pooled analysis. Analyses of predictors of relapse and response are now needed to improve the therapeutic value of this modality.

INTRODUCTION Biventricular pacing system implantation is a time-consuming and challenging procedure. A critical step in biventricular pacemaker implantation is coronary sinus (CS) cannulation. CS cannulation can be achieved either using dedicated guiding catheters (guiding catheter alone positioning strategy, GCA) or with the aid of an electrophysiology catheter advanced inside the guiding catheter (electrophysiology catheter aided positioning strategy, EPA).
AIM OF THE STUDY To evaluate whether the EPA technique is useful for reducing CS cannulation time compared to a conventional GCA technique.
METHODS Thirty-four consecutive patients were randomly assigned to the GCA (18 patients) or EPA (16 patients) CS cannulation strategy.
RESULTS Time to successful catheterization of CS was 5.0 +/- 2.4 min in the EPA group versus 10.1 +/- 5.4 min in the GCA group p = 0.004. Fluoroscopy time was 4.6 +/- 2.3 min in the EPA group versus 9.2 +/- 4.9 min in the GCA group p = 0.004.

Children responded to measures of attitudes (Adjective Checklist) and behavioral intentions (Shared Activities Questionnaire). Children rated the typical boy more favorably than the boy showing autistic symptoms. When compared to descriptive information alone, the combination of descriptive and explanatory information resulted in improved third- and fourth-graders' but not fifth-graders' attitudes toward the child with autism. Combined information improved behavioral intentions across grades; however, girls (vs. boys) were more responsive to information as evidenced by differences in academic intentions. The combination of descriptive and explanatory information about autism appears to have a positive effect on children's attitudes and behavioral intentions.

15358868,['visual search'],"Superior visual search in adults with autism.

Recent studies have suggested that children with autism perform better than matched controls on visual search tasks and that this stems from a superior visual discrimination ability. This study assessed whether these findings generalize from children to adults with autism. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that, like children, adults with autism were superior to controls at searching for targets. Experiment 3 showed that increases in target-distractor similarity slowed the visual search performance of the control group significantly more than that of the autism group, suggesting that the adults with autism have a superior visual discrimination ability. Thus, these experiments replicate in adults previous findings in children with autism. Superior unique item detection in adults with autism, stemming from enhanced discrimination, is discussed in the light of the possible role of stimulus processing disturbances in the disorder in general.

PATIENTS Twenty-six patients within 3 months of onset of stroke were randomised to receive physical therapy (control group) or therapy and retraining (experimental group), most of the patients in both groups with left hemiplegia. The experimental group was significantly older than the control group.
METHOD Thirteen patients received early conventional therapy, and 13 received therapy combined with standing balance training by biofeedback (BPM Monitor). Clinical measures were collected at entry (J0), once when subjects began to walk (JM) and 30 days later (JM + 30). Gait spatiotemporal parameters were collected by use of the Vicon system at JM and JM + 30.
RESULTS Whatever the method of rehabilitation, the clinical scores improved significantly between J0 and JM + 30, except for spasticity. The time between stroke and the beginning of walking was not significantly different between both groups. Gait velocity increased significantly between JM and JM + 30 in both groups, with no difference between groups. The walking pattern was improved for both groups, with a significant increase of the duration of the paretic limb single stance. The experimental group significantly improved the duration of the reception double stance on the paretic limb between JM and JM + 30 compared with the control group (P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION Both groups demonstrated improvement in the rehabilitation unit. The benefits of visual biofeedback by forceplate system training suggest particular improvement of anticipation equilibrium with conventional therapy.

A visual analogue scale (1-100) was used to record pain, unpleasantness of taste and overall discomfort experienced. Overall, the procedure was associated with minimal pain and discomfort in both groups. There was no significant difference in pain or overall discomfort experienced between the two groups; however, the sensation of bad taste was significantly worse in the cophenylcaine group. In linear regression, factors that predicted the overall unpleasantness of the experience were primarily pain experienced and secondarily unpleasantness of taste. We conclude that the routine use of cophenylcaine for nasal preparation is not justified before flexible nasendoscopy.

15858959,"['Saccharomyces boulardii', 'S. boulardii', 'placebo ( placebo', 'placebo']","Effects of Saccharomyces boulardii in children with acute diarrhoea.

AIM Certain probiotic agents, e.g. Lactobacillus GG, have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment of acute childhood diarrhoea, but few studies have examined the effect of Saccharomyces boulardii. We evaluated the effect of S. boulardii in children with acute diarrhoea.
METHODS Two hundred children were randomized to receive S. boulardii in a granulated form in a daily dose of 250 mg (S. boulardii group) or placebo (placebo group) for 5 d. Clinical and demographic characteristics on admission were similar between the study groups.
RESULTS The medians of the average stool frequency after the second day of the treatment were significantly lower in the S. boulardii group than in the placebo group (p = 0.003). The duration of diarrhoea significantly reduced in the S. boulardii group compared with the placebo group (4.7 vs 5.5 d, p = 0.03). The effect of S. boulardii on watery diarrhoea became apparent after the second day of the treatment. The duration of hospital stay was shorter in the S. boulardii group than in the placebo group (2.9 vs 3.9 d, p < 0.001). Four children from the placebo group versus only one child from the S. boulardii group had persisting diarrhoea.
CONCLUSION The placebo-controlled study suggested that S. boulardii significantly reduced the duration of acute diarrhoea and the duration of hospital stay. S. boulardii seems to be a promising agent for the amelioration of the course of acute diarrhoea in children when used therapeutically.

BACKGROUND The Early Detection and Intervention Programme of the German Research Network on Schizophrenia (GRNS) investigates the initial prodromal phase of psychosis in a multidimensional approach. Two intervention strategies are being studied by two large-scale multicentre projects.
AIMS To present the concept of the intervention studies, and to provide an interim report of the recruitment procedure.
METHOD Comprehensive cognitive-behavioural therapy has been developed for patients in the ""early initial prodromal state"". For patients in the ""late initial prodromal state"" the atypical neuroleptic amisulpride is explored. Both interventions are evaluated in randomised controlled trials using clinical management as the control condition.
RESULTS Between January 2001 and March 2003, 1212 individuals seeking help for mental health problems were screened for putative prodromal symptoms at four university centres. More than 388 individuals fulfilled criteria for both interventions and 188 (48.5%) gave informed consent to participate in the trials.
CONCLUSIONS The screening procedure appears to be feasible and trial participation seems to be acceptable to a relevant proportion of people at increased risk of developing psychosis.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of branch chain amino acid (BCAA) enriched formula on nutritional status and postoperative fatigue for digestive surgery patients.
METHODS Forty patients who underwent digestive surgery were randomly received parenteral nutrition with either BCAA enriched (study group, n=20) or routine amino acid (control group, n=20) for seven consecutive days. Nitrogen balance,serum total protein, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, retinol binding protein and postoperative fatigue score were monitored during the postoperative period.
RESULTS The cumulative postoperative fatigue scores were lower in BCAA group than that in the control group at the 4th, 5th and 7th day after operation (P< 0.05). Patients achieved positive nitrogen balance 2 days earlier in the study group than that in the control group, but there was no significant difference in cumulative nitrogen balance between the two groups. There was no significant difference in elevation of serum total protein, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin at the 7th day after operation between the two groups (P > 0.05), compared with those at the first day after operation. The serum level of retinol binding protein was higher in BCAA-enriched group than that in the control group (P=0.004).
CONCLUSION TPN with BCAA enriched formula can reduce postoperative fatigue score and improve the nutritional status for digestive surgery patients.

Parents of children who receive the diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) experience a situational crisis related to receiving the diagnosis, which causes feelings of distress and urgency to access services for the affected child. This paper describes a randomized trial (n = 31) that was conducted at a regional diagnostic center of a large metropolitan children's hospital to (a) refine a nursing intervention designed for parents of children with ASD and (b) to identify methodological revisions for a larger study. A secondary purpose was to test the effects of a post-diagnosis nursing intervention on parents' reports of stress, impact of event (diagnosis), and use of services after a child is newly diagnosed with ASD. The intervention consisted of usual care plus 3 hours contact with a pediatric nurse practitioner (PNP) for counseling, instruction, and assistance with implementation of the recommended treatment plan. The control group received only the usual care post-diagnosis, which consisted of a 1-hour consultation session to receive the results of diagnostic tests and a written copy of the recommended treatment plan provided by a developmental pediatrician and/or PNP. Between group differences in measures of ""impact of event"" and ""perceived stress"" were not statistically significant. This was attributed to a small sample size. A larger study is feasible and recommended with an expanded nursing intervention and a significantly larger sample recruited from an additional recruitment site. Nurses working with this special population must recognize that parents have information and counseling needs that begin after they receive the diagnosis of ASD for their child and can address these needs with a standardized nursing intervention.

16427787,"['melatonin', 'placebo']","Sleep-anticipating effects of melatonin in the human brain.

Melatonin, the hormone produced nocturnally by the pineal gland, is an endogenous regulator of the sleep-wake cycle. The effects of melatonin on brain activities and their relation to induction of sleepiness were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Melatonin, but not placebo, reduced task-related activity in the rostro-medial aspect of the occipital cortex during a visual-search task and in the auditory cortex during a music task. These effects correlated with subjective measurements of fatigue. In addition, melatonin enhanced the activation in the left parahippocampus in an autobiographic memory task. Results demonstrate that melatonin modulates brain activity in a manner resembling actual sleep although subjects are fully awake. Furthermore, the fatigue inducing effect of melatonin on brain activity is essentially different from that of sleep deprivation thus revealing differences between fatigues related to the circadian sleep regulation as opposed to increased homeostatic sleep need. Our findings highlight the role of melatonin in priming sleep-associated brain activation patterns in anticipation of sleep.

PURPOSE To compare maintenance epoetin alfa administered once every 3 weeks with continued weekly epoetin alfa for patients with cancer-associated anemia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were randomly assigned at enrollment to receive three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U subcutaneously (SC), followed by either standard weekly epoetin alfa (40K arm) or 120,000 U of epoetin alfa (120K arm) SC every 3 weeks for 18 additional weeks.
RESULTS Three hundred sixty-five patients were enrolled. One hundred eighty-three patients were assigned to the 40K arm, and 182 were assigned to the 120K arm. There was no difference in the proportion of patients requiring transfusions during the study (23% in 40K arm and 18% in 120K arm, P = .22) or specifically during the maintenance phase (13% in 40K arm v 15% in 120K arm, P = .58). Patients randomly assigned to the 40K arm were more likely to have a > or = 2 or > or = 3 g/dL hemoglobin (Hb) increment, were more likely to have a drug dose held because of high Hb, and had higher mean end-of-study Hb levels. Toxicities, including thromboembolism, and overall survival were similar. Patients in the 40K arm had a higher global quality of life (QOL) at baseline for unclear reasons, whereas patients in the 120K arm had a greater global QOL improvement during the study, so end-of-study QOL was equivalent.
CONCLUSION After three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U, a dose of 120,000 U can be administered safely once every 3 weeks without increasing transfusion needs or sacrificing QOL. The Hb increment is somewhat greater with continued weekly epoetin alfa. Lack of blinding as a result of different treatment schedules may have confounded results.

To verify the efficacy and the tolerability of local immunotherapy (LI) by inhalation of a powder extract of house dust mite (HDM), in comparison with parenteral immunotherapy (PI) by injection, 10 patients with asthma due to HDM were studied in a blind fashion. 5 patients (Group A) underwent LI and subcutaneous injections of placebo, 5 patients (Group B) underwent PI and inhalation of lactose for 6 months. In both groups each inhalation was preceded by premedication with disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) (40 mg). In Group A a significant decrease in symptoms score and in peak expiratory flow (PEF)-derived parameters was observed already after 3 months of treatment, and 2 patients lost the late component of the bronchial response to the challenge with HDM. No significant variation was found in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and ultrasonically nebulized distilled water (UNDW) and in immunologic humoral and cellular parameters in peripheral blood after treatment in either group. No local important adverse reactions were observed in Group A and no systemic side effects were observed in either group. We conclude that LI is as effective as PI, but more rapid in its action, in the treatment of asthma due to HDM. Moreover, LI is locally well tolerated, providing DSCG is inhaled before each therapeutic inhalation, and does not induce systemic side effects.

The safety of anti-C. difficile whey protein concentrate (anti-CD WPC) is supported by analytical data comparing the composition of raw milk from immunized cows versus that from non-immunized cows, and the composition of anti-CD WPC versus that of regular whey protein concentrate. Additionally, a prospective clinical study was conducted in 77 patients with CDAD to demonstrate the safety of consuming anti-CD WPC to prevent relapse of the infection. This study, which included adverse event monitoring, physical examinations, and extensive hematological and biochemical assessments, showed that anti-CD WPC is safe to consume by patients with CDAD. The available analytical and clinical evidence demonstrate that anti-CD WPC is safe for use by individuals with CDAD, under the described conditions of use.

There were 4 cases with possible systemic fungal infection in the itraconazole group, and there were 8 possible and 3 probable cases in the fluconazole group. Adverse events did not significantly differ in the 2 groups. In patients with MDS or in the remission-induction phase of chemotherapy, the numbers of cases with probable or possible infections were lower in the itraconazole group than in the fluconazole group, whereas no difference was seen in patients with AML or in the consolidation phase of therapy. In patients with neutrophil counts of >0.1 x 10(9)/L lasting for more than 4 weeks, the frequency of infection in the fluconazole group (5 of 9 patients) was significantly higher than in the itraconazole group (0 of 7 patients; P = .03). Our results suggest that both drugs were well tolerated in patients with AML or MDS who received chemotherapy and that the efficacy of itraconazole for prophylaxis against systemic fungal disease is not inferior to that of fluconazole.

BACKGROUND Few studies have compared treatment strategies in patients with asthma poorly controlled on low dose inhaled corticosteroids, and little is known about the effects of different treatments on airway inflammation. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, we compared the effects of salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate (FP) (Seretide; SFC) and FP plus montelukast (FP/M) on sputum inflammatory markers, airway responsiveness, lung function, and symptoms in adult asthmatics.
METHODS Sixty-six subjects were randomised to SFC or FP/M for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was changes in neutrophil, eosinophil, macrophage, lymphocyte, and epithelial cell levels in induced sputum. Additional outcomes included the change in other sputum markers of airway inflammation, airway responsiveness, symptom control, and lung function.
RESULTS Both treatments had no significant effect on induced sputum inflammatory cells, although there was a trend for a reduction in sputum eosinophils. Both treatments significantly improved airway responsiveness, whereas SFC generally led to greater improvements in symptom control and lung function than FP/M. FP/M led to significantly greater reductions in sputum cysteinyl leukotrienes than SFC (treatment ratio 1.80; 95% CI 1.09, 2.94).
CONCLUSION Both treatments led to similar control of eosinophilic airway inflammation, although PEF and symptom control were better with SFC. STUDY NUMBER: SAM40030 (SOLTA).

The vaccine Zostavax has been shown to prevent herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia and is recommended for individuals > or =60 years of age. This study compared the safety and the immunogenicity of a refrigerator-stable formulation (Zostavax refrigerated) with those of the current formulation (Zostavax frozen) in subjects > or =50 years of age. Subjects with a negative history for HZ were randomized 1:1 to receive one dose of either formulation. Enrollment was stratified 1:2 by age (50 to 59 years and > or =60 years). Safety was evaluated for 28 days postvaccination. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody responses were measured by a glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA). The primary endpoints were the VZV antibody geometric mean titer (GMT; day 28), the VZV antibody geometric mean rise (GMR; days 1 to 28), and the incidence of vaccine-related serious adverse experiences (AEs) over 28 days. The refrigerated (n = 182) and frozen (n = 185) formulations induced similar GMTs (727.4 and 834.4 gpELISA units/ml, respectively); the estimated GMT ratio (refrigerated formulation/frozen formulation) was 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.71 to 1.07). The GMRs were 2.6- and 2.9-fold, respectively. No vaccine-related serious AEs were reported in either group, and the safety profiles of the formulations were generally similar. The frequencies of injection-site AEs during follow-up were 35.6% and 46.4% in the refrigerated and the frozen formulation groups, respectively, and were generally mild. The frequencies of systemic AEs were similar in the two groups, and those of vaccine-related AEs were approximately 6% in both groups. The refrigerator-stable formulation of Zostavax has an acceptable safety profile and is as immunogenic as the frozen formulation; thus, the vaccine may be used in clinical settings where freezer availability is limited.

Addition of epirubicin to adjuvant chemotherapy can provide important benefits for patients with early breast cancer, but the optimal dose remains unclear. Further improvements can be achieved with dose-dense regimens, but densification of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) has proved difficult, with FEC(60) providing little benefit over standard chemotherapy and FEC(100) associated with toxicity. We investigated the feasibility of two intermediate dose-dense FEC regimens. Patients were randomised to six cycles of FEC(75) or FEC(90), with all three drugs given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle. Patients also received pegfilgrastim 6 mg as a single subcutaneous injection on day 2 of each cycle. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects receiving > or =85% relative dose intensity and was achieved by 96% and 88% of patients in the FEC(75) and FEC(90) arms, respectively. Of 147 FEC(75) infusions, 4.1% were delayed, while 9.8% of 143 FEC(90) infusions were delayed. The most common reasons for delay were adverse events and personal/logistical reasons. One dose reduction occurred during the study (FEC(90)), related to diarrhoea. Grade 3-4 haematological toxicities were reported in two patients in the FEC(90) arm. There were no incidences of febrile neutropenia during the study. The most common adverse events were increases in liver enzymes and gastrointestinal events; no event resulted in discontinuation. Only one patient (FEC(90)) experienced serious adverse events (vomiting and throat oedema). In conclusion, dose-dense FEC(75 )and FEC(90) are feasible with pegfilgrastim support. These regimens are associated with a very low risk of Grade 3-4 toxicity.

Interventions were conducted 30 min daily for 5-6 weeks. Assessments of JA skills, SP skills, mother-child interactions, and language development were collected at 4 time points: pre- and postintervention and 6 and 12 months postintervention by independent testers. Results indicate that expressive language gains were greater for both treatment groups compared with the control group, and results could not be explained by differences in other interventions in which children participated. For children beginning treatment with the lowest language levels, the JA intervention improved language outcome significantly more than did the SP or control interventions. These findings suggest clinically significant benefits of actively treating JA and SP skills in young children with autism.

OBJECTIVE To test the non-inferiority of once-daily (QD) oral amoxicillin to the recommended twice-daily (BID) oral penicillin V in GABHS pharyngitis.
METHODS This was a randomised non-inferiority trial carried out in a school-based clinic in New Zealand. Children presenting with GABHS pharyngitis were randomised to oral amoxicillin 1500 mg QD (or 750 mg if bodyweight was <or=30 kg) or to oral penicillin V 500 mg BID (or 250 mg if bodyweight was <or=20 kg) for 10 days. Observed medication and weekend diary cards were used to monitor adherence.
OUTCOME Eradication of GABHS, determined with follow-up throat cultures on days 3-6, 12-16 and 26-36. GABHS isolates were serotyped to distinguish bacteriological treatment failures (and relapses) from new acquisitions. Non-inferiority was defined as an upper 95% confidence limit (CL) for the difference in success of eradication in the amoxicillin and penicillin V treatment groups of <or=10%.
RESULTS 353 children with positive throat swabs for GABHS were randomised to amoxicillin (n = 177) or penicillin V (n = 176). The upper 95% CL for the differences in positive cultures between the antibiotics was 4.9% at days 3-6, 6.5% at days 12-16 and 8.5% at days 26-36. Treatment failures (including relapses) occurred at each visit in 5.8%, 12.7% and 10.7% of amoxicillin recipients and 6.2%, 11.9% and 11.3% of penicillin V recipients, respectively. No significant differences in resolution of symptoms were noted between treatment groups. One case of unsubstantiated acute rheumatic fever occurred after 7 days of amoxicillin.
CONCLUSION In this adequately powered study, once-daily oral amoxicillin is not inferior to twice-daily penicillin V for the treatment and eradication of GABHS in children with pharyngitis.

METHOD Forty-nine children with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention (n = 26) or wait-list control (n = 23) conditions.
RESULTS Relative to children in the wait-list group, program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention, as indicated by parent-report measures. Teacher-report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to post-treatment. Treatment group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management strategies for story characters at post-intervention than at pre-intervention, whereas control participants were not. However, there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body-posture recognition measures. Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post-intervention.

Vibrotactile stimuli can elicit compelling auditory sensations, even when sound energy levels are minimal and undetectable. It has previously been shown that subjects judge auditory tones embedded in white noise to be louder when they are accompanied by a vibrotactile stimulus of the same frequency. A first experiment replicated this result at four different levels of auditory stimulation (no tone, tone at detection threshold, tone at 5 dB above threshold, and tone at 10 dB above threshold). The presence of a vibrotactile stimulus induced an increase in the perceived loudness of auditory tones at three of the four values in this range. In two further experiments, a 2-interval forced-choice procedure was used to assess the nature of this cross-modal interaction. Subjects were biased when vibrotaction was applied in one interval, but applying vibrotaction in both intervals produced performance comparable to conditions without vibrotactile stimuli. This demonstrates that vibrotaction is sometimes ignored when judging the presence of an auditory tone. Hence the interaction between vibrotaction and audition does not appear to occur at an early perceptual level.

The specificity of bupropion SR effects was also tested in exploratory analyses.
DESIGN Data from a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of bupropion SR were submitted to mediation analyses.
SETTING Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention, Madison, WI, USA.
PARTICIPANTS A total of 403 adult, daily smokers without contraindications to bupropion SR use.
INTERVENTION Participants were assigned randomly to receive a 9-week course of bupropion SR or placebo pill and to receive eight brief individual counseling sessions or no counseling.
MEASUREMENTS Ecological momentary assessment ratings of smoking behavior and putative mediators were collected pre- and post-quit.
FINDINGS Results of structural equation and hierarchical linear models did not support the hypothesis that bupropion SR treatment improves short-term abstinence by reducing withdrawal distress or affecting the subjective effects of a lapse cigarette, but provided partial support for mediation by cigarette craving reduction and enhanced positive affect. Bupropion SR effects on point-prevalence abstinence at 1 month post-quit were also mediated partially by enhanced motivation to quit and self-efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS Results provided some support for models of bupropion SR treatment and relapse and suggested that motivational processes may partially account for bupropion SR efficacy.

RESULTS Risk factors retained in the model included poor performance status, absolute neutrophil count < or =2.0 x 10(9) cells/L in the previous cycle, the first cycle of chemotherapy, DOX versus PLD and advanced age. A precycle risk score from > or =25 to <40 for a given patient was identified as being the optimal threshold for sensitivity (58.0%) and specificity (78.7%). Patients with a score at or beyond this threshold would be considered at high risk for developing NC in later cycles.
CONCLUSION The use of this model may enhance patient care by targeting preventative therapies (eg, granulocyte colony stimulating factor or PLD) to those MBC patients most likely to experience NC during anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by decreased interest and engagement in social interactions and by enhanced self-focus. While previous theoretical approaches to understanding autism have emphasized social impairments and altered interpersonal interactions, there is a recent shift towards understanding the nature of the representation of the self in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Still, the neural mechanisms subserving self-representations in ASD are relatively unexplored.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We used event-related fMRI to investigate brain responsiveness to images of the subjects' own face and to faces of others. Children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children viewed randomly presented digital morphs between their own face and a gender-matched other face, and made ""self/other"" judgments. Both groups of children activated a right premotor/prefrontal system when identifying images containing a greater percentage of the self face. However, while TD children showed activation of this system during both self- and other-processing, children with ASD only recruited this system while viewing images containing mostly their own face.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE This functional dissociation between the representation of self versus others points to a potential neural substrate for the characteristic self-focus and decreased social understanding exhibited by these individuals, and suggests that individuals with ASD lack the shared neural representations for self and others that TD children and adults possess and may use to understand others.

18975051,['iopamidol'],"Bolus injection of contrast agents with various iodine concentrations and delivery rates for intracranial three-dimensional CT angiography: evaluation of intracranial arteriovenous contrast using a multidetector-row CT scanner.

PURPOSE We evaluated the difference in computed tomography (CT) attenuation values of the intracranial arterial and venous systems among the various contrast injection protocols (higher iodine delivery rate or higher concentration of the agent) on the source images of intracranial three-dimensional CT angiography (3D-CTA) using a multidetector-row CT (MDCT) scanner.
MATERIALS AND METHODS We used 100 ml of iopamidol 300 at an injection rate of 3.0 ml/s, 100 ml of iopamidol 300 at an injection rate of 3.7 ml/s, and 80 ml of iopamidol 370 at an injection rate of 3.0 ml/s. There were 10 patients in each group. Attenuation values of the bilateral internal carotid arteries (ICAs), basilar artery trunk, bilateral cavernous sinuses (CSs), and Galenic vein were measured quantitatively on the axial CT angiographic source images obtained by four-channel MDCT.
RESULTS Injection of the high-concentration contrast with a higher iodine-delivery rate achieved good arteriovenous contrast at the cavernous portion. With the same rate of iodine delivery, injection of the intermediate concentrate agent increased the CT value of not only the ICAs but also the CSs.
CONCLUSION High-concentration contrast could increase ICA attenuation without intracavernous attenuation gain during the ""first-pass"" phase.

This paper presents the rationale for a 24-week, randomized trial designed to test whether risperidone plus structured parent training would be superior to risperidone only on measures of noncompliance, irritability and adaptive functioning. In this model, medication reduces tantrums, aggression and self-injury; parent training promotes improvement in noncompliance and adaptive functioning. Thus, medication and parent training target related, but separate, outcomes. At week 24, the medication was gradually withdrawn to determine whether subjects in the combined treatment group could be managed on a lower dose or off medication without relapse. Both symptom reduction and functional improvement are important clinical treatment targets. Thus, experimental evidence on the beneficial effects of combining pharmacotherapy and exportable behavioral interventions is needed to guide clinical practice.

BACKGROUND Breast cancer surgery performed with the patient under general anesthesia has been associated with a relatively high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Between 60% and 80% of patients who undergo mastectomy (with axillary dissection) experience PONV. We previously reported that propofol at a subhypnotic dose of 0.5 mg/kg was more effective than placebo in preventing PONV in women who undergo mastectomy.
OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of a subhypnotic dose of propofol with the conventional antiemetics droperidol and metoclopramide for the prophylaxis of PONV after breast cancer surgery in Japanese patients.
METHODS In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Japanese women were randomized to 1 of 4 groups to receive IV administration of propofol 0.5 mg/kg, droperidol 20 microg/kg, metoclopramide 0.2 mg/kg, or placebo (isotonic saline) immediately after skin suture. A standard general anesthetic technique, including sevoflurane and air in oxygen, was used. All episodes of PONV during the first 24 hours after anesthesia administration were recorded by an investigator who was blinded to treatment assignment. The investigator questioned the patients as to whether they experienced extrapyramidal symptoms. To maintain the integrity of the study results, none of the patients received preanesthetic medication.
RESULTS A total of 100 women (mean [SD] age, 52 [7] years; height, 154 [6] cm; weight, 54 [7] kg) were included in the study. Each study group comprised 25 patients. There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to patient demographics, surgery type, or awakening time. The prevalences of PONV 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia were 28% with propofol (P = 0.005), 32% with droperidol (P = 0.011), and 60% with metoclopramide (P = NS), compared with placebo (68%). No significant difference in the prevalence of PONV was found between patients receiving propofol and those receiving droperidol, and propofol and droperidol were associated with significantly lower prevalences of PONV compared with metoclopramide (P = 0.022 and P = 0.043, respectively). Extrapyramidal symptoms were not reported in any of the groups.
CONCLUSIONS The prevalences of PONV were not significantly different between propofol 0.5 mg/kg and droperidol 20 microg/kg 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia in this small, select group of Japanese women who underwent breast cancer surgery. The prevalences of PONV were significantly lower with propofol and droperidol compared with metoclopramide 0.2 mg/kg and placebo.

Primary RP were screened and assigned to either the nifedipine SR group (Group N) or the Ginkgo biloba extract group (Group G) in the ratio of 2:1. After a run-in period of 2 weeks, patients received treatment for 8 weeks. We observed the percent improvement of the RP attack rate between before and after the 8-week treatment. Ninety-three subjects were randomly assigned. The percent improvement in Group N was 50.1% at 8 weeks after treatment, while it was 31.0% in Group G (p = 0.03). No serious adverse events occurred, and almost adverse events were mild and improved without specific treatment. nifedipine SR was more effective than Ginkgo biloba extract for treatment of primary RP in Korean patients.

BACKGROUND Postoperative epidural analgesia (EA) and femoral nerve block (FNB) provided effective pain relief However, EA has common side effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, dizziness, and hypotension. Some investigations found that those side effects were less in FNB than in EA. However the analgesic equivalent of both techniques have not been confirmed.
OBJECTIVE The authors compared continuous epidural infusion (CEI) with continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) regarding the postoperative analgesic efficacy, side effects, postoperative knee rehabilitation, and hospital length of stay (LOS).
MATERIAL AND METHOD In this prospective, randomized controlled study, 61 ASA physical status I-III patients scheduled for elective unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) under spinal anesthesia (SA) participated. The patients were allocated into two groups. In the ward, patients in Group I (CEI) were maintained by continuous infusion of 0.125% levobupivacaine with morphine 0.0125 mg/ml (4 ml/hr), Group II (CFNB) were maintained by 0.125% levobupivacaine (8 ml/hr).
RESULTS Patients in the CFNB group, the VAS scores at PO6-12 hr and tramadol IV requirement were significantly greater than the CEI group (VAS: PO6 hr p-value = 0.001, PO12 hr p-value = 0.004). Patients in the CEI group experienced dizziness, pruritus, and PONV more than the CFNB group significantly. Patient satisfaction was greater with the CFNB group although postoperative knee rehabilitation and the hospital LOS were not different.
CONCLUSION CFNB represents the optimal analgesia with fewer side effects and greater patient, satisfaction. The rehabilitation indices and duration of hospital stay are comparable in both groups.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are effective for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but are difficult to use. Dabigatran etexilate is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to the active direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. It is administered in a fixed dose without laboratory monitoring and is being compared with warfarin (international normalized ratio 2-3) in the RE-LY trial. Two doses of dabigatran (110 and 150 mg BID) are being evaluated. RE-LY is a phase 3, prospective, randomized, open-label multinational (44 countries) trial of patients with nonvalvular AF and at least 1 risk factor for stroke. Recruitment concluded with a total of 18,113 patients. Patients who were VKA-naive and experienced are included in balanced proportions. The primary outcome is stroke (including hemorrhagic) or systemic embolism. Safety outcomes are bleeding, liver function abnormalities, and other adverse events. Adjudication of end points is blinded to drug assignment. The trial is expected to accrue a minimum of 450 events with a minimum 1-year of follow-up. RE-LY is the largest AF stroke prevention trial yet undertaken. It is unique because it includes equal numbers of VKA-experienced and naive patients and evaluates 2 different dosages of dabigatran, which may allow tailoring of dosing to individual patient needs. The worldwide site distribution and broad range of stroke risk further increase the general applicability of the trial. Results are expected in 2009.

The two treatment groups were well-matched in age, sex, stage and performance status. There was a statistically significant difference in response rate and the median survival between two groups. The overall response rate (CR+PR) was 91.5% for Chinese herb group and 46.9% for control group (P less than 0.001). The median survival was 16 months for the traditional Chinese Kidney-tonifying decoction group, and 10 months for the control group (P less than 0.05). Survival curve (Kaplan-meire's) of the Chinese herb group was better than that of the control group. 10 patients of Chinese herb group was alive beyond more than 2 years. Until now, 4 patients in the Chinese herb group, one in the control group are still enjoying their disease-free life for more than 7 years. Hematologic toxicities were observed much frequently in the patients of the control group (P less than 0.005 and 0.01/WBC and BPC). Results of animal experiments with the same traditional medicinal decoctions as used in clinic have showed immuno-enhancement activities. These results have showed that the traditional Chinese Kidney-tonifying decoction may enhance non-specific immunology activities and may be much useful for solid cancer patients as an adjuvant treatment.

Changes in continuously recorded 'Finapres' finger blood pressure in ten normotensive and seven hypertensive subjects induced by self-inflation of the cuff or just wearing the inflated cuff were studied. Inflating the cuff caused an instantaneous rise in systolic blood pressure of 13 and 12 mm Hg (hypertensive and normotensive subjects, respectively). Wearing the inflated cuff did not change blood pressure. Thus the rise in pressure was related to the muscular activity required for cuff inflation. Systolic blood pressure took on average 7 s and at most 21 s to return to baseline level after stopping cuff inflation. Since first Korotkoff sounds may already be heard after 10-15 s when following recommended procedures, self-recorded systolic blood pressure may be recorded as too high when subjects inflate their cuff at too low a pressure or deflate it too fast.

OBJECTIVE To explore the short-term treatment effect of the auditory integrative training on autistic children and provide them with clinical support for rehabilitative treatment.
METHODS A total of 81 cases of autistic children were selected through the standard of DSM-4 and clinical case study was used. They were divided randomly into experimental group and control one, and respectively received auditory integrative training and no training based on the multiple therapies. The patients were investigated using clinical manifestation and Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) and intelligence quotient (IQ) before and after six months of treatment. The effect was evaluated through the changes of clinical manifestations and scores of ABC and IQ. The changes of scores of IQ were determined with Gesell and WPPSI or WISC-R.
RESULTS Compared with 40 patients of the control group after the six months of the auditory integrative training, 41 of the experimental group had greatly improved in many aspects, such as the disorders of their language, social interactions and typical behavior symptoms while they had not changed in their abnormal behaviors. The scores of IQ or DQ had increased and scores of ABC had dropped. The differences between the two groups were greatly significant in statistics (P < 0.01). The decreasing level of both ABC scores and the increasing level of the IQ scores were negatively correlated with age, and the decreasing level of ABC scores was in line regression(positive correlation) with base IQ.
CONCLUSION The treatment of auditory integrative training (AIT) could greatly improve on language disorders, the difficulties of social interactions, typical behavior symptoms and developmental levels,therefore it is positive to the autistic children in its short-term treatment effect.

SUMMARY This study examined whether 24 months of weight training exercises enhanced the effectiveness of risedronate, calcium, and vitamin D in maintaining or improving bone mineral density (BMD) in 223 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Subjects who were > or =50% adherent to exercise had no improvement in BMD but were less likely to lose BMD.
INTRODUCTION This study examined whether (1) postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (BCS) with bone loss taking 24 months of risedronate, calcium, and vitamin D had increased bone mineral density (BMD) at the total hip, femoral neck, L1-L4 spine, total radius and 33% radius, and decreased bone turnover; (2) subjects who also participated in strength/weight training (ST) exercises had greater increases in BMD and greater decreases in bone turnover; and (3) subjects who also exercised were more likely to preserve (at least maintain) BMD.
METHODS Postmenopausal BCS (223) were randomly assigned to exercise plus medication or medication only groups. Both groups received 24 months of 1,200 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D daily and 35 mg of risedronate weekly, and the exercise group additionally had ST exercises twice weekly.
RESULTS After 24 months, women who took medications without exercising had significant improvements in BMD at the total hip (+1.81%) and spine (+2.85%) and significant decreases in Alkphase B (-8.7%) and serum NTx (-16.7%). Women who also exercised had additional increases in BMD at the femoral neck (+0.29%), total hip (+0.34%), spine (+0.23%), total radius (+0.30%), and additional decreases in Alkphase B (-2.4%) and Serum NTx (-6.5%). Additional changes in BMD and bone turnover with exercise were not significant. Subjects who were > or =50% adherent to exercise were less likely to lose BMD at the total hip (chi-square [1] = 4.66, p = 0.03) and femoral neck (chi-square [1] = 4.63, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION Strength/weight training exercises may prevent loss of BMD in postmenopausal BCS at risk for bone loss.

INTRODUCTION This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety and to compare dosing schedules of gemcitabine combined with S-1 in chemo-naïve non-small cell lung cancer patients.
METHODS Patients with chemo-naïve stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer were randomized into two treatment arms. Patients were given oral S-1 (60 mg/m/d, twice a day) from days 1 to 14 with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m/d) on days 1 and 8 (arm A) or on days 8 and 15 (arm B). This cycle was repeated every 21 days.
RESULTS A total of 80 patients were entered in this trial. The primary end point of this study was response rate. The response rates of arm A and arm B were 22.0 and 28.9%, respectively (p = 0.606). Median time to treatment failure in arm A was 3.6 months and 4.8 months in arm B. Median time to progression in arm A was 4.1 months and 5.5 months in arm B.

BACKGROUND Remote ischaemic preconditioning attenuates cardiac injury at elective surgery and angioplasty. We tested the hypothesis that remote ischaemic conditioning during evolving ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and done before primary percutaneous coronary intervention, increases myocardial salvage.
METHODS 333 consecutive adult patients with a suspected first acute myocardial infarction were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by computerised block randomisation to receive primary percutaneous coronary intervention with (n=166 patients) versus without (n=167) remote conditioning (intermittent arm ischaemia through four cycles of 5-min inflation and 5-min deflation of a blood-pressure cuff). Allocation was concealed with opaque sealed envelopes. Patients received remote conditioning during transport to hospital, and primary percutaneous coronary intervention in hospital. The primary endpoint was myocardial salvage index at 30 days after primary percutaneous coronary intervention, measured by myocardial perfusion imaging as the proportion of the area at risk salvaged by treatment; analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00435266.
FINDINGS 82 patients were excluded on arrival at hospital because they did not meet inclusion criteria, 32 were lost to follow-up, and 77 did not complete the follow-up with data for salvage index. Median salvage index was 0.75 (IQR 0.50-0.93, n=73) in the remote conditioning group versus 0.55 (0.35-0.88, n=69) in the control group, with median difference of 0.10 (95% CI 0.01-0.22; p=0.0333); mean salvage index was 0.69 (SD 0.27) versus 0.57 (0.26), with mean difference of 0.12 (95% CI 0.01-0.21; p=0.0333). Major adverse coronary events were death (n=3 per group), reinfarction (n=1 per group), and heart failure (n=3 per group).
INTERPRETATION Remote ischaemic conditioning before hospital admission increases myocardial salvage, and has a favourable safety profile. Our findings merit a larger trial to establish the effect of remote conditioning on clinical outcomes.

OBJECTIVE Forceps biopsy is the standard method to obtain specimens in endoscopically visible lesions. It is common to combine forceps biopsy with cytology methods to increase the diagnostic yield. Although the flexible cryoprobe has been established for bronchoscopic interventions in malignant stenosis, the obtained biopsies, called ""cryobiopsies,"" have not been investigated in a large cohort of patients. The aim of this feasibility study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic yield and safety of cryobiopsy and forceps biopsy.
METHODS During a 6-year period, 296 patients with visible endoluminal tumor lesions were included in the study at the bronchoscopy unit of a university hospital. In the first consecutively conducted 55 cases, both techniques, forceps biopsy and cryobiopsy, were applied simultaneously. Pathologic and quantitative image analyses were performed to evaluate the size and quality of the obtained specimens. We evaluated the safety and diagnostic yield to describe the feasibility of cryobiopsy.
RESULTS Comparative analysis of the first conducted and randomly assigned 55 cases revealed a significantly higher diagnostic yield for cryobiopsy compared with forceps biopsy (89.1% vs 65.5%, P < .05). In this cohort, quantitative image analysis showed significantly larger biopsies regarding size and artifact-free tissue sections for cryobiopsy compared with forceps biopsy (P < .0001). The overall diagnostic yield of cryobiopsy was 89.5%. Mild bleeding occurred in 11 cases (3.7%), moderate bleeding occurred in 3 cases (1.0%), and severe bleeding occurred in 1 case (0.3%).
CONCLUSION Cryobiopsy is safe and increases the diagnostic yield in endobronchial tumor lesions. The method also is feasible under routine conditions.

Subjective pain ratings were obtained immediately and 8 hours after VRH (used as an adjunct to standard analgesic care) and compared to both adjunctive VR without hypnosis and standard care alone. VRH patients reported less pain intensity and less pain unpleasantness compared to control groups. These preliminary findings suggest that VRH analgesia is a novel technology worthy of further study, both to improve pain management and to increase availability of hypnotic analgesia to populations without access to therapist-provided hypnosis and suggestion.

The effects of the high intake of Maillard reaction products (MRP) on calcium availability in adolescents and across Caco-2 cell monolayers were examined. In a 2 week randomized two-period crossover trial, 18 male adolescents consumed two diets, named white diet (WD) and brown diet (BD), which were poor and rich in MRP, respectively. A 3 day balance was performed at the end of each period, and fasting blood samples were collected. Calcium solubility and absorption across Caco-2 cells were studied after the in vitro digestion of the diets. The in vitro assay showed similar solubility after the in vitro digestion and similar transport across Caco-2 cells. In accordance, calcium bioavailability in adolescents did not vary between the diets (%WD = 40.4 +/- 5.1, %BD = 38.2 +/- 3.6). Serum and urine biochemical parameters related to calcium status and bone metabolism remained unaltered. Only deoxypyridinoline values were significantly lower after consumption of the BD (13.0 +/- 1.1 compared to 18.3 +/- 2.1 nM/Mm Cr in the WD), possibly indicative of less efficient bone turnover during this period. As calcium acquired during adolescence is essential to maximize peak bone mass and to prevent osteoporosis, possible long-term effects of excessive MRP intake during this period warrant attention.

BACKGROUND In recent years some studies have been published supporting the efficacy of light exposure, physical activity, sleep control and a Mediterranean diet pattern on the improvement or prevention of depression. However, to our knowledge, there have been no studies using all these measures together as an adjuvant antidepressant strategy.
METHODS Multicenter, randomized, controlled, two arm-parallel, clinical trial. Eighty depressed patients undergoing standard antidepressant treatment will be advised to follow four additional hygienic-dietary recommendations about exercise, diet, sunlight exposure and sleep. Outcome measures will be assessed before and after the 6 month intervention period.
DISCUSSION We expect the patients in the active recommendations group to experience a greater improvement in their depressive symptoms. If so, this would be a great support for doctors who might systematically recommend these simple and costless measures, especially in primary care.

The therapeutic effects of each treatment were compared both clinically and microbiologically. Records of plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth, probing attachment level and microscopic counts were obtained at 0, 4, 6 and 8 weeks. The results showed marked decreases in probing depth and density of micro-organisms in both the RP and TC + RP groups. In particular, the TC + RP group was characterized by a decreased rate of bleeding on pocket probing and an increased probing attachment gain. The above findings demonstrated that root planning is effective in the treatment of furcation involvement and that the effects are enhanced by the local administration of TC films.

METHODS We undertook a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adults with previously treated immune thrombocytopenia of more than 6 months' duration who had baseline platelet counts lower than 30,000 per μL. Patients were randomly allocated (in a 2:1 ratio) treatment with local standard of care plus 50 mg eltrombopag or matching placebo once daily for 6 months. Randomisation was done centrally with a computer-generated randomisation schedule and was stratified by baseline platelet count (≤ 15,000 per μL), use of treatment for immune thrombocytopenia, and splenectomy status. Patients, investigators, and those assessing data were masked to allocation. Dose modifications were made on the basis of platelet response. Patients were assessed for response to treatment (defined as a platelet count of 50,000-400,000 per μL) weekly during the first 6 weeks and at least once every 4 weeks thereafter; the primary endpoint was the odds of response to eltrombopag versus placebo. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00370331.
FINDINGS Between Nov 22, 2006, and July 31, 2007, 197 patients were randomly allocated to treatment groups and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (135 eltrombopag, 62 placebo). 106 (79%) patients in the eltrombopag group responded to treatment at least once during the study, compared with 17 (28%) patients in the placebo group. The odds of responding were greater in patients in the eltrombopag group compared with those in the placebo group throughout the 6-month treatment period (odds ratio 8·2, 99% CI 3·59-18·73; p<0·0001). 37 (59%) patients receiving eltrombopag reduced concomitant treatment versus ten (32%) patients receiving placebo (p=0·016). 24 (18%) patients receiving eltrombopag needed rescue treatment compared with 25 (40%) patients receiving placebo (p=0·001). Three (2%) patients receiving eltrombopag had thromboembolic events compared with none in patients on placebo. Nine (7%) eltrombopag-treated patients and two (3%) in the placebo group had mild increases in alanine aminotransferase concentration, and five (4%) eltrombopag-treated patients (vs none allocated to placebo) had increases in total bilirubin. Four (7%) patients taking placebo had serious bleeding events, compared with one (<1%) patient treated with eltrombopag.
INTERPRETATION Eltrombopag is effective for management of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, and could be particularly beneficial for patients who have not responded to splenectomy or previous treatment. These benefits should be balanced with the potential risks associated with eltrombopag treatment.

OBJECTIVE We aim to study the efficacy of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture in children with autism spectrum disorder.
METHODS A single-blind randomized control trial was conducted in 50 children. These children were randomly assigned to the treatment group with tongue acupuncture (40 sessions over 8 weeks) or the control group (sham tongue acupuncture to nonacupoints in the tongue).
RESULTS There was improvement in both the treatment and control groups in all assessed measures but more so in the treatment than in the control group: (1) eye-hand coordination, performance, and practical reasoning of Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale; (2) sensory-motor, social, affectual, language, and total score of Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Scale; (3) Comprehension Language age in the Reynell Language Developmental Scale; and (4) Total Score and Mental Age in Symbolic Play Test. The only statistically significant improvement in the treatment as compared to the control group was seen in self-care and cognition domains of the Functional Independence Measure for children.
CONCLUSIONS We had demonstrated that a short course of acupuncture had efficacy in improving various developmental and behavioral aspects of children with autism. The long-term efficacy in functional gain needs to be further explored.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the immediate clinical and microbiological efficacy of doxycycline (100 mg for 14 days) was carried out to determine the benefit of adjunctive medication in 16 patients with localized juvenile periodontitis. Measurements of gingival fluid flow, probing depths, bleeding on probing and suppuration were determined at 2 periodontal sites with and 2 without radiographic attachment loss, at weeks 0, 1, 3 and 8. Subgingival bacterial samples were taken with curettes from the same sites. Spirochaetes were searched for by dark-field microscopy. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, pigmented and non-pigmented Bacteroides spp., Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium and Actinomyces spp. were cultured on various selective and non-selective media. Bacterial species found at least in 50% of the patients and comprising on average 5% or more of the cultivable flora were included in the analysis. Neither short-term clinical nor microbiological efficacy beyond that of a course of mechanical debridement alone was found by using systemic medication with doxycycline in patients with localized juvenile periodontitis.

OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of visual and kinesthetic locomotor imagery training on walking performance and to determine the clinical feasibility of incorporating auditory step rhythm into the training.
DESIGN Randomized crossover trial.
SETTING Laboratory of a Department of Physical Therapy.
SUBJECTS Fifteen subjects with post-stroke hemiparesis.
INTERVENTION Four locomotor imagery trainings on walking performance: visual locomotor imagery training, kinesthetic locomotor imagery training, visual locomotor imagery training with auditory step rhythm and kinesthetic locomotor imagery training with auditory step rhythm.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The timed up-and-go test and electromyographic and kinematic analyses of the affected lower limb during one gait cycle.
RESULTS After the interventions, significant differences were found in the timed up-and-go test results between the visual locomotor imagery training (25.69 ± 16.16 to 23.97 ± 14.30) and the kinesthetic locomotor imagery training with auditory step rhythm (22.68 ± 12.35 to 15.77 ± 8.58) (P < 0.05). During the swing and stance phases, the kinesthetic locomotor imagery training exhibited significantly increased activation in a greater number of muscles and increased angular displacement of the knee and ankle joints compared with the visual locomotor imagery training, and these effects were more prominent when auditory step rhythm was integrated into each form of locomotor imagery training. The activation of the hamstring during the swing phase and the gastrocnemius during the stance phase, as well as kinematic data of the knee joint, were significantly different for posttest values between the visual locomotor imagery training and the kinesthetic locomotor imagery training with auditory step rhythm (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS The therapeutic effect may be further enhanced in the kinesthetic locomotor imagery training than in the visual locomotor imagery training. The auditory step rhythm together with the locomotor imagery training produces a greater positive effect in improving the walking performance of patients with post-stroke hemiparesis.

21106663,['alcohol intervention'],"Time-varying smoking abstinence predicts lower depressive symptoms following smoking cessation treatment.

INTRODUCTION The question of whether abstinence during the months following a planned quit attempt exacerbates or improves depressive symptoms is an important clinical issue. Extant research has primarily modeled between-person covariation between postquit abstinence and depressive symptom trajectories. However, this approach cannot account for potential third variables between participants that may affect both smoking and depression. Accordingly, the current study examined within-person covariation between time-varying abstinence and depressive symptom in a multilevel model (MLM), which allowed for transitions between smoking statuses within a participant.
METHODS Participants were 236 heavy drinking smokers in a randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of incorporating brief alcohol intervention into smoking cessation treatment. Depressive symptoms and biochemically verified abstinence were assessed 1 week prior to and 2, 8, 16, and 26 weeks after quit date.
RESULTS MLMs indicated a slight increase in depressive symptoms over time in the sample as a whole. However, there was an inverse relation between time-varying abstinence (vs. smoking) and concurrent level of depressive symptoms, indicating that transitions from smoking to abstinence within individuals were associated with reductions in depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS During the first 6 months following a planned quit attempt, being abstinent in a particular week appears to be associated with lower levels of concurrent depressive symptoms. These results are not concordant with the view that intentional smoking abstinence exacerbates depressive symptoms. Efforts to promote smoking cessation should highlight that individuals are likely to feel more rather than less psychologically healthy when they successfully quit smoking.

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to determine the factors associated with the favorable effect of pioglitazone on atheroma progression.
BACKGROUND Diabetes mellitus is associated with accelerated coronary atheroma progression. Pioglitazone slowed progression compared with glimepiride in this population.
METHODS In all, 360 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease were treated with pioglitazone or glimepiride for 18 months in the PERISCOPE (Pioglitazone Effect on Regression of Intravascular Sonographic Coronary Obstruction Prospective Evaluation) study. Coronary atheroma progression was evaluated by serial intravascular ultrasound. The relationship between changes in biochemical parameters, percent atheroma volume, and total atheroma volume was investigated.
RESULTS Pioglitazone-treated patients demonstrated greater increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and reductions in glycated hemoglobin, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein. Significant correlations were observed between changes in percent atheroma volume and triglycerides (r = 0.15, p = 0.04), triglyceride/HDL-C ratio (r = 0.16, p = 0.03), and glycated hemoglobin (r = 0.16, p = 0.03) with pioglitazone, and changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.15, p = 0.05), apolipoprotein B (r = -0.16, p = 0.04), and apolipoprotein A-I (r = -0.20, p = 0.01) with glimepiride. Substantial atheroma regression, compared to progression, was associated with greater relative increases in HDL-C (14.2% vs. 7.8%, p = 0.04), relative decreases in triglycerides (-13.3% vs. -1.9%, p = 0.045), triglyceride/HDL-C ratio (-22.5 vs. -9.9%, p = 0.05), and decrease in glycated hemoglobin (-0.6% vs. -0.3%, p = 0.01). Multivariable analysis revealed that pioglitazone-induced effects on triglyceride/HDL-C were associated with changes in percent atheroma volume (p = 0.03) and total atheroma volume (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS Favorable effects of pioglitazone on the triglyceride/HDL-C ratio correlated with delayed atheroma progression in diabetic patients. This finding highlights the potential importance of targeting atherogenic dyslipidemia in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease.

21393467,['perturbations to treadmill walking'],"Distinct fast and slow processes contribute to the selection of preferred step frequency during human walking.

Humans spontaneously select a step frequency that minimizes the energy expenditure of walking. This selection might be embedded within the neural circuits that generate gait so that the optimum is pre-programmed for a given walking speed. Or perhaps step frequency is directly optimized, based on sensed feedback of energy expenditure. Direct optimization is expected to be slow due to the compounded effect of delays and iteration, whereas a pre-programmed mechanism presumably allows for faster step frequency selection, albeit dependent on prior experience. To test for both pre-programmed selection and direct optimization, we applied perturbations to treadmill walking to elicit transient changes in step frequency. We found that human step frequency adjustments (n = 7) occurred with two components, the first dominating the response (66 ± 10% of total amplitude change; mean ± SD) and occurring quite quickly (1.44 ± 1.14 s to complete 95% of total change). The other component was of smaller amplitude (35 ± 10% of total change) and took tens of seconds (27.56 ± 16.18 s for 95% completion). The fast process appeared to be too fast for direct optimization and more indicative of a pre-programmed response. It also persisted even with unusual closed-loop perturbations that conflicted with prior experience and rendered the response energetically suboptimal. The slow process was more consistent with the timing expected for direct optimization. Our interpretation of these results is that humans may rely heavily on pre-programmed gaits to rapidly select their preferred step frequency and then gradually fine-tune that selection with direct optimization.

BACKGROUND We aimed to analyze clinical, microbiologic, and serologic effects of chlorhexidine (CHX) chips used as a subgingival controlled-release delivery device before and immediately after scaling and root planing (SRP).
METHODS Twenty-four patients presenting with ≥12 teeth with probing depth (PD) ≥5 mm and bleeding on probing were assigned in test or control groups. After prophylaxis, CHX chips (test) or placebo chips (control) were placed in pockets with PD ≥5 mm. Ten days later, SRP was performed in all teeth with PD ≥4 mm in a single appointment. Immediately after SRP, new chips were inserted in all pockets with PD ≥5 mm. Parameters were assessed at baseline; beginning of SRP; and 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Subgingival samples were obtained at baseline; beginning of SRP; and at 1 month after treatment. Periodontal pathogens Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were analyzed. Serum levels of high sensitive C-reactive and lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins were measured. The changes of the parameters between and within the groups were tested by Mann-Whitney U test (P <0.05).
RESULTS All clinical and serologic parameters improved in both groups over time. There was a significant difference in clinical attachment level (CAL) gain from baseline to 6 months between groups (1.17 mm in the test group versus 0.79 mm in the placebo group) (P <0.05). The treatment with CHX chips showed a greater reduction of the microorganisms of the ""red complex"" after 1 month (P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION The use of CHX chips before and immediately after SRP improved CAL and reduced the subgingival microorganisms of the red complex in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.

BACKGROUND A large body of evidence suggests that fine particulate matter (PM) air pollution is a cause of cardiovascular disease, but little is known in particular about the cardiovascular effects of indoor air pollution from household use of solid fuels in developing countries. RESPIRE (Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects) was a randomized trial of a chimney woodstove that reduces wood smoke exposure.
OBJECTIVES We tested the hypotheses that the stove intervention, compared with open fire use, would reduce ST-segment depression and increase heart rate variability (HRV).
METHODS We used two complementary study designs: a) between-groups comparisons based on randomized stove assignment, and b) before-and-after comparisons within control subjects who used open fires during the trial and received chimney stoves after the trial. Electrocardiogram sessions that lasted 20 hr were repeated up to three times among 49 intervention and 70 control women 38-84 years of age, and 55 control subjects were also assessed after receiving stoves. HRV and ST-segment values were assessed for each 30-min period. ST-segment depression was defined as an average value below -1.00 mm. Personal fine PM [aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM₂.₅] exposures were measured for 24 hr before each electrocardiogram.
RESULTS PM₂.₅ exposure means were 266 and 102 μg/m³ during the trial period in the control and intervention groups, respectively. During the trial, the stove intervention was associated with an odds ratio of 0.26 (95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.90) for ST-segment depression. We found similar associations with the before-and-after comparison. The intervention was not significantly associated with HRV.
CONCLUSIONS The stove intervention was associated with reduced occurrence of nonspecific ST-segment depression, suggesting that household wood smoke exposures affect ventricular repolarization and potentially cardiovascular health.

BACKGROUND In the interest of preserving residual insulin secretory capacity present at the time of diagnosis with type 1 diabetes (T1D), we compared the efficacy of starting insulin pump therapy at diagnosis with standard multiple daily insulin injections (MDIs).
METHODS We conducted a prospective, randomized, pilot trial comparing MDI therapy with continuous subcutaneous insulin therapy (pump therapy) in 24 patients, 8-18 years old, with newly diagnosed T1D. Subjects were evaluated at enrollment and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after initial diagnosis of T1D. Preservation of insulin secretion, measured by mixed-meal-stimulated C-peptide secretion, was compared after 6 and 12 months of treatment. Between-group differences in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), continuous glucose sensor data, insulin utilization, anthropometric measures, and patient satisfaction with therapy were also compared at multiple time points.
RESULTS Initiation of pump therapy within 1 month of diagnosis resulted in consistently higher mixed-meal tolerance test-stimulated C-peptide values at all time points, although these differences were not statistically significant. Nonetheless, improved glycemic control was observed in insulin pump-treated subjects (more time spent with normoglycemia, better mean HbA1c), and pump-treated subjects reported comparatively greater satisfaction with route of treatment administration.
CONCLUSIONS Initiation of insulin pump therapy at diagnosis improved glycemic control, was well tolerated, and contributed to improved patient satisfaction with treatment. This study also suggests that earlier use of pump therapy might help to preserve residual β-cell function, although a larger clinical trial would be required to confirm this.

METHODS 130 EMs-related infertility patients of blood stasis and toxin accumulation syndrome diagnosed and treated by laparoscopic surgery were randomly assigned to two groups, i.e., the test group (75 cases) and the control group (55 cases). All patients received routine progesterone treatment after laparoscopic surgery. QYJDR was given to patients in the test group after laparoscopic surgery, lasting for twelve months. The pregnancy rate within one year after laparoscopic surgery were compared between the two groups. The Chinese medicine syndrome integrals, serum endometrium antibody (EMAb) and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) levels were compared between before drug therapy and three months after drug therapy.
RESULTS The pregnancy rate within one year after laparoscopic surgery was higher in the test group than in the control group [61.33% (46/75) vs 45.45% (25/55)], showing significant difference (P<0.05). The Chinese medicine syndrome integral was (16.07 +/- 6.77) score and (7.25 +/- 3.27) score before and 3 months after drug therapy in the test group, while it was (15.92 +/- 7.51) score and (12.73 +/- 6.12) score in the control group. The Chinese medicine syndrome integral after drug therapy was lower than that before drug therapy in the same group. Besides, the integral difference between before and after drug therapy was higher in the test group than in the control group [(9.12 +/- 6.16) score vs (3.48 +/- 2.06) score)], showing statistical difference (P<0.05). After three-month drug therapy, the serum EMAb negative conversion rate was obviously higher in the test group than in the control group (44.44% vs 15.62%), showing statistical difference (P<0.05). The serum CA125 level was (31.88 +/- 15.78) U/mL before drug therapy and (18.82 +/- 10.08) U/mL three months after drug therapy in the test group, while it was (30.63 +/- 19.28) U/mL and (18.05 +/- 11.20) U/mL respectively in the control group. It was lowered after drug therapy in the two groups with statistical difference (P<0.05). There was no statistical difference between the two groups after drug therapy (P>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic surgery in combination of QYJDR could effectively improve clinical symptoms of EMs patients of blood stasis and toxin accumulation syndrome, promote negative conversion of EMAb, lower serum CA125 levels, and elevate the clinical pregnancy rate. QYJDR is an effective formula in treatment of EMs-related infertility.

This study was conducted to determine the long-term effect of flosequinan, a new orally administered arterial and venous dilator, on the clinical course of patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure. Seventeen patients on chronic digitalis and diuretic therapy were randomized to receive either flosequinan (n = 9) or placebo (n = 8) in a double-blind fashion. Changes in symptomatology, exercise performance, and left ventricular function were assessed serially during the two-month treatment period. During the course of therapy, a modest improvement in the symptom scores and functional classification of the flosequinan-treated patients was observed. Flosequinan evoked a significant increase in maximal exercise capacity. While long-term flosequinan administration also effected a progressive increase in resting heart rate, it did not consistently improve indices of left ventricular systolic function. The addition of chronic vasodilator therapy with flosequinan to standard digitalis-diuretic regimens is capable of inducing clinical improvement in patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure. Trials involving larger patient populations will be necessary to confirm the results of this preliminary study and to determine the extent of clinical improvement, subpopulations benefited, role in heart failure therapeutics, and so forth.

BACKGROUND One of the reasons physiotherapy services are provided to emergency departments (EDs) and emergency extended care units (EECUs) is to review patients' mobility to ensure they are safe to be discharged home.
AIM To investigate whether a physiotherapy service to an EECU altered the rate of hospital admission, rate of re-presentation to the ED, visits to community healthcare practitioners, return to usual work/home/leisure activities and patient satisfaction.
METHODS A randomised trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken in an EECU. The sample comprised 186 patients (mean age 70 years, 123 (66%) female patients, 130 (70%) trauma) who were referred for physiotherapy assessment/intervention. Referral occurred at any stage of the patients' EECU admission. All participants received medical/nursing care as required. The physiotherapy group also received physiotherapy assessment/intervention.
RESULTS The physiotherapy group had a 4% (95% CI -18% to 9%) lower rate of admission to hospital than the control group and a 4% (95% CI -6% to 13%) higher rate of re-presentation to the ED, which were statistically non-significant (p≥0.45). Differences between groups for use of community healthcare resources, return to usual work/home/leisure activities and satisfaction with their EECU care were small and not significant.
CONCLUSION A physiotherapy service for EECU patients, as provided in this study, did not reduce the rate of hospital admission, rate of re-presentation to the ED, use of community healthcare resources, or improve the rate of return to usual work/home/leisure activities or patient satisfaction.

There is concern that public education about testicular cancer (TC) may cause unnecessary anxiety. Psychological theory suggests that if threat (eg, TC) information is accompanied with threat control strategies (eg, testicular self-examination; TSE) anxiety is less likely. Male students (N=443) were randomized to either a TC or TC +TSE information group or a no information control group, and assessed at three time points. Anxiety levels did not differ between the groups and exposure to TC+TSE resulted in greater perceived message benefit, increased intention to self-examine and lower message denigration. This suggests TC information is not anxiogenic, but inclusion of TSE information may improve acceptance of disease awareness information.

INTRODUCTION Time in therapeutic range (TTR) for international normalized ratio (INR) is an accepted quality measure of anticoagulation control in patient populations, but its usefulness for predicting stroke and bleeding in individuals is not well understood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS In a nested case control analysis among ACTIVE W study patients, cases with stroke and cases with bleeding were separately matched with controls. Several anticoagulation quality measures were compared, overall and in a time-dependent manner.
RESULTS 32 cases with ischemic stroke and 234 cases with bleeding in the analysis were matched in a 4:1 ratio to 122 and 865 controls, respectively. Follow-up duration was 257±154days for the stroke analysis and 222±146days for the bleeding analysis. Compared with their respective controls, the study mean TTR of both stroke cases (53.9%±25.1 vs 63.4%±24.8; p=0.055) and bleeding cases (56.2%±25.4 vs 63.4%±26.8; p<0.001) was lower. Time below range for stroke and time above range for bleeding were only greater in the last month leading up to the event, not over the entire study period. Rather, over the entire study period bleeding cases spent more time below range than controls (26.8%±25.9 vs 20.8%±24.0; p=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS TTR was lower in individual AF patients with stroke or bleeding compared with matched controls in ACTIVE W. Maintaining a high TTR, with equal importance to avoid low and high INRs, is a relevant goal of individual patient treatment to prevent stroke and bleeding.

BACKGROUND Hormonal contraceptives are used widely but their effects on HIV-1 risk are unclear. We aimed to assess the association between hormonal contraceptive use and risk of HIV-1 acquisition by women and HIV-1 transmission from HIV-1-infected women to their male partners.
METHODS In this prospective study, we followed up 3790 heterosexual HIV-1-serodiscordant couples participating in two longitudinal studies of HIV-1 incidence in seven African countries. Among injectable and oral hormonal contraceptive users and non-users, we compared rates of HIV-1 acquisition by women and HIV-1 transmission from women to men. The primary outcome measure was HIV-1 seroconversion. We used Cox proportional hazards regression and marginal structural modelling to assess the effect of contraceptive use on HIV-1 risk.
FINDINGS Among 1314 couples in which the HIV-1-seronegative partner was female (median follow-up 18·0 [IQR 12·6-24·2] months), rates of HIV-1 acquisition were 6·61 per 100 person-years in women who used hormonal contraception and 3·78 per 100 person-years in those who did not (adjusted hazard ratio 1·98, 95% CI 1·06-3·68, p=0·03). Among 2476 couples in which the HIV-1-seronegative partner was male (median follow-up 18·7 [IQR 12·8-24·2] months), rates of HIV-1 transmission from women to men were 2·61 per 100 person-years in couples in which women used hormonal contraception and 1·51 per 100 person-years in couples in which women did not use hormonal contraception (adjusted hazard ratio 1·97, 95% CI 1·12-3·45, p=0·02). Marginal structural model analyses generated much the same results to the Cox proportional hazards regression.
INTERPRETATION Women should be counselled about potentially increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition and transmission with hormonal contraception, especially injectable methods, and about the importance of dual protection with condoms to decrease HIV-1 risk. Non-hormonal or low-dose hormonal contraceptive methods should be considered for women with or at-risk for HIV-1.

BACKGROUND We sought to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of transcatheter intramyocardial administration of myoblasts in patients with heart failure (HF).
METHODS MARVEL is a randomized placebo-controlled trial of image-guided, catheter-based intramyocardial injection of placebo or myoblasts (400 or 800 million) in patients with class II to IV HF and ejection fraction <35%. Primary end points were frequency of serious adverse events (safety) and changes in 6-minute walk test and Minnesota Living With HF score (efficacy). Of 330 patients intended for enrollment, 23 were randomized (MARVEL-1) before stopping the study for financial reasons.
RESULTS At 6 months, similar numbers of events occurred in each group: 8 (placebo), 7 (low dose), and 8 (high dose), without deaths. Ventricular tachycardia responsive to amiodarone was more frequent in myoblast-treated patients: 1 (placebo), 3 (low dose), and 4 (high dose). A trend toward improvement in functional capacity was noted in myoblast-treated groups (Δ6-minute walk test of -3.6 vs +95.6 vs +85.5 m [placebo vs low dose vs high dose; P = .50]) without significant changes in Minnesota Living With HF scores.
CONCLUSIONS In HF patients with chronic postinfarction cardiomyopathy, transcatheter administration of myoblasts in doses of 400 to 800 million cells is feasible and may lead to important clinical benefits. Ventricular tachycardia may be provoked by myoblast injection but appears to be a transient and treatable problem. A large-scale outcome trial of myoblast administration in HF patients with postinfarction cardiomyopathy is feasible and warranted.

BACKGROUND Incidence and severity of herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia increase with age, associated with age-related decrease in immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV). One dose of zoster vaccine (ZV) has demonstrated substantial protection against HZ; this study examined impact of a second dose of ZV.
METHODS Randomized, double-blind, multicenter study with 210 subjects ≥60 years old compared immunity and safety profiles after one and two doses of ZV, separated by 6 weeks, vs. placebo. Immunogenicity was evaluated using VZV interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay and VZV glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent antibody (gpELISA) assay. Adverse experiences (AEs) were recorded on a standardized Vaccination Report Card.
RESULTS No serious vaccine-related AEs occurred. VZV IFN-γ ELISPOT geometric mean count (GMC) of spot-forming cells per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells increased in the ZV group from 16.9 prevaccination to 49.5 and 32.8 at 2 and 6 weeks postdose 1, respectively. Two weeks, 6 weeks and 6 months postdose 2, GMC was 44.3, 42.9, and 36.5, respectively. GMC in the placebo group did not change during the study. The peak ELISPOT response occurred ∼2 weeks after each ZV dose. The gpELISA geometric mean titers (GMTs) in the ZV group were higher than in the placebo group at 6 weeks after each dose. Correlation between the IFN-γ ELISPOT and gpELISA assays was poor.
CONCLUSIONS ZV was generally well-tolerated and immunogenic in adults ≥60 years old. A second dose of ZV was generally safe, but did not boost VZV-specific immunity beyond levels achieved postdose 1.

The effect of changing the rate of infusion of propofol for induction of anaesthesia was studied in 60 elderly patients. Propofol was administered at 300, 600 or 1200 ml h-1 until loss of consciousness (as judged by loss of verbal contact with the patient) had been achieved. The duration of induction was significantly longer (P less than 0.001) with the slower infusion rates (104, 68 and 51 s), but the total dose used was significantly less (P less than 0.001) in these patients (1.2, 1.6 and 2.5 mg kg-1, respectively). The decrease in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure was significantly less in the 300-ml h-1 group at the end of induction and immediately after induction (P less than 0.01).

A new immunomodulating agent, bestatin (INN: Ubenimex has low toxicity even after long-term oral administration and has significant modifications in immunological response. A cooperative randomized controlled study of bestatin immunotherapy in combination with remission maintenance chemotherapy for adult acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) was performed. After induction of complete remission, patients were randomized to the bestatin group (30 mg/bw per os (po) daily) and the control group. The 101 eligible cases (bestatin: 48, control: 53) were analyzed; the bestatin group achieved longer remission than the control group and a statistically significant longer survival. Though this prolongation of remission was not significant in the bestatin group compared to the control group in the 15-49 yr age group, in the 50-65 yr age group it was significantly longer. Bestatin is shown to be a clinically useful drug for immunotherapy of adult ANLL, since it has prolonged survival and remission especially in elderly patients, with few side-effects.

22271197,['psychosocial interventions'],"Goal attainment scaling as an outcome measure in randomized controlled trials of psychosocial interventions in autism.

Goal attainment scaling (GAS) holds promise as an idiographic approach for measuring outcomes of psychosocial interventions in community settings. GAS has been criticized for untested assumptions of scaling level (i.e., interval or ordinal), inter-individual equivalence and comparability, and reliability of coding across different behavioral observation methods. We tested assumptions of equality between GAS descriptions for outcome measurement in a randomized trial (i.e., measurability, equidistance, level of difficulty, comparability of behavior samples collected from teachers vs. researchers and live vs. videotape). Results suggest GAS descriptions can be evaluated for equivalency, that teacher collected behavior samples are representative, and that varied sources of behavior samples can be reliably coded. GAS is a promising measurement approach. Recommendations are provided to ensure methodological quality.

22341427,['cardiac transplantation'],"Intermediate-term mortality and cardiac transplantation in infants with single-ventricle lesions: risk factors and their interaction with shunt type.

OBJECTIVE The study objective was to identify factors associated with death and cardiac transplantation in infants undergoing the Norwood procedure and to determine differences in associations that might favor the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or a right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt.
METHODS We used competing risks methodology to analyze death without transplantation, cardiac transplantation, and survival without transplantation. Parametric time-to-event modeling and bootstrapping were used to identify independent predictors.
RESULTS Data from 549 subjects (follow-up, 2.7 ± 0.9 years) were analyzed. Mortality risk was characterized by early and constant phases; transplant was characterized by only a constant phase. Early phase factors associated with death included lower socioeconomic status (P = .01), obstructed pulmonary venous return (P < .001), smaller ascending aorta (P = .02), and anatomic subtype. Constant phase factors associated with death included genetic syndrome (P < .001) and lower gestational age (P < .001). The right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt demonstrated better survival in the 51% of subjects who were full term with aortic atresia (P < .001). The modified Blalock-Taussig shunt was better among the 4% of subjects who were preterm with a patent aortic valve (P = .003). Lower pre-Norwood right ventricular fractional area change, pre-Norwood surgery, and anatomy other than hypoplastic left heart syndrome were independently associated with transplantation (all P < .03), but shunt type was not (P = .43).
CONCLUSIONS Independent risk factors for intermediate-term mortality include lower socioeconomic status, anatomy, genetic syndrome, and lower gestational age. Term infants with aortic atresia benefited from a right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt, and preterm infants with a patent aortic valve benefited from a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. Right ventricular function and anatomy, but not shunt type, were associated with transplantation.

Children acquire general knowledge about many kinds of things, but there are few known means by which this knowledge is acquired. In this article, it is proposed that children acquire generic knowledge by sharing in pretend play. In Experiment 1, twenty-two 3- to 4-year-olds watched pretense in which a puppet represented a ""nerp"" (an unfamiliar kind of animal). For instance, in one scenario, the nerp ate and disliked a carrot. When subsequently asked generic questions about real nerps, children's responses suggested that they had learned general facts (e.g., nerps dislike carrots). In Experiment 2, thirty-two 4- to 5-year-olds learned from scenarios lacking pretend speech or sound effects. The findings reveal a long overlooked means by which children can acquire generic knowledge.

The present study reports the effects of referential communication training in individuals formally diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Participants were 20 children with ASD (M age = 14.3 yr., SD = 4.2; 6 girls, 14 boys) in the role of speakers and 20 control children, who acted as listeners. They were all enrolled in mainstream compulsory education. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were defined according to the clinical diagnosis of ASD, the presence or absence of additional or associated disability, previous training in referential communication, and any drug treatment. Speakers were randomly assigned to one of two groups (trained vs untrained). Linguistic age, cognitive level and autistic symptoms were analyzed, respectively, with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WISC-R or WAIS-III), and the Autistic Behavior Checklist (ABC). Communicative abilities were analyzed through two indexes related to message complexity and self-regulation. The trained group was trained in referential communication tasks (task analysis, role taking, and task evaluation), while the untrained group took part in a communicative game but without any specific communicative training. The results showed that the complexity of emitted messages had improved statistically significantly in the trained group as an effect of training. Ecological referential communication is shown to be an appropriate paradigm for studying the communicative process and its products and could be used to develop and implement a training program focused on those skills in which individuals with ASD are most deficient.

BACKGROUND Children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are at high risk for developing significant anxiety. Anxiety can adversely impact functioning across school, home and community environments. Cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) are frequently used with success for children with anxiety symptoms. Modified CBT interventions for anxiety in children with ASD have also yielded promising results.
METHODS Fifty children with high-functioning ASD and anxiety were randomizedto group CBT or treatment-as-usual (TAU) for 12 weeks. Independent clinical evaluators, blind to condition, completed structured interviews (Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule – Parent Version;ADIS-P) pre- and post-intervention condition.
RESULTS Forty-seven children completed either the CBT or TAU condition. Results indicated markedly better outcomes for the CBT group. Significant differences by group were noted in Clinician Severity Ratings, diagnostic status, and clinician ratings of global improvement. In the intent-to-treat sample, 10 of 20 children (50%) in the CBT group had a clinically meaningful positive treatment response, compared to 2 of 23 children (8.7%) in the TAU group.
CONCLUSIONS Initial results from this randomized, designed treatment study suggest that agroup CBT intervention specifically developed for children with ASD may be effective in decreasing anxiety. Limitations of this study include small sample size, lack of an attention control group, and use of outcome measures normed with typically developing children

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to determine atheroma progression in patients with spotty calcification.
BACKGROUND Although extensively calcified atherosclerotic lesions have been proposed to be clinically quiescent, the presence of spotty calcification within plaque has been reported to be associated with an increased incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events. The relationship between spotty calcification and disease progression has not been investigated.
METHODS A total of 1,347 stable patients with angiographic coronary artery disease underwent serial evaluation of atheroma burden with intravascular ultrasound imaging. Patients with spotty calcification were identified based on the presence of lesions (1 to 4 mm in length) containing an arc of calcification of <90°. Clinical characteristics and disease progression were compared between patients with spotty calcification (n = 922) and those with no calcification (n = 425).
RESULTS Patients with spotty calcification were older (age 56 years vs. 54 years; p = 0.001), more likely to be male (68% vs. 54%; p = 0.01), and have a history of diabetes mellitus (30% vs. 24%; p = 0.01) and myocardial infarction (28% vs. 20%; p = 0.004), and have lower on-treatment high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (48 ± 16 mg/dl vs. 51 ± 17 mg/dl; p = 0.001). Patients with spotty calcification demonstrated a greater percent atheroma volume (PAV) (36.0 ± 7.6% vs. 29.0 ± 8.5%; p < 0.001) and total atheroma volume (174.6 ± 71.9 mm(3) vs. 133.9 ± 64.9 mm(3); p < 0.001). On serial evaluation, spotty calcification was associated with greater progression of PAV (+0.43 ± 0.07% vs. +0.02 ± 0.11%; p = 0.002). Although intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and blood pressure lowering therapy slowed disease progression, these efficacies were attenuated in patients with spotty calcification.
CONCLUSIONS The presence of spotty calcification is associated with more extensive and diffuse coronary atherosclerosis and accelerated disease progression despite use of medical therapies.

BACKGROUND Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) impacts quality of life (QoL). Psychological factors influence the course of the disease and should be targeted for intervention.
METHODS Our study was a prospective, randomised control trial. Fifty-six outpatients were randomly chosen and allocated to a treatment group or a waiting-list control group. Treatment group patients attended three relaxation-training sessions and received an audio disc for home practice. Evaluations performed pre and post-treatment: state anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, QoL with the IBD Questionnaire. The Visual Analogue Scale assessed pain, depression, stress and mood. Patients completed a symptom monitoring diary. The control group's symptoms were monitored without study-related treatment.
RESULTS Thirty-nine subjects completed the study and were included in the data analysis. Following the relaxation-training intervention, the treatment group's (n = 18) measured results showed a statistically significant improvement as compared to the control group (n = 21) (time by treatment interaction): anxiety levels decreased (p < 0.01), QoL and mood improved (p < 0.05), while levels of pain and stress decreased (p < 0.01).

METHOD Seventy-seven children were randomly assigned to 2 treatments (parent + therapist EMT or therapist-only EMT) and received 36 intervention sessions. Children were assessed before, immediately after, 6 months after, and 12 months after intervention. Separate linear regressions were conducted for each standardized and observational measure at each time point.
RESULTS Parents in the parent + therapist group demonstrated greater use of EMT strategies at home than untrained parents in the therapist-only group, and these effects maintained over time. Effect sizes for observational measures ranged from d = 0.10 to d = 1.32 favoring the parent + therapist group, with the largest effect sizes found 12 months after intervention.

BACKGROUND Although collaborative care is effective for treating depression and other mental disorders in primary care, there have been no randomized trials of collaborative care specifically for patients with Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
OBJECTIVE To compare a collaborative approach, the Three Component Model (3CM), with usual care for treating PTSD in primary care.
DESIGN The study was a two-arm, parallel randomized clinical trial. PTSD patients were recruited from five primary care clinics at four Veterans Affairs healthcare facilities and randomized to receive usual care or usual care plus 3CM. Blinded assessors collected data at baseline and 3-month and 6-month follow-up.
PARTICIPANTS Participants were 195 Veterans. Their average age was 45 years, 91% were male, 58% were white, 40% served in Iraq or Afghanistan, and 42% served in Vietnam.
INTERVENTION All participants received usual care. Participants assigned to 3CM also received telephone care management. Care managers received supervision from a psychiatrist.
MAIN MEASURES PTSD symptom severity was the primary outcome. Depression, functioning, perceived quality of care, utilization, and costs were secondary outcomes.
KEY RESULTS There were no differences between 3CM and usual care in symptoms or functioning. Participants assigned to 3CM were more likely to have a mental health visit, fill an antidepressant prescription, and have adequate antidepressant refills. 3CM participants also had more mental health visits and higher outpatient pharmacy costs.
CONCLUSIONS Results suggest the need for careful examination of the way that collaborative care models are implemented for treating PTSD, and for additional supports to encourage primary care providers to manage PTSD.

BACKGROUND Children with autism have difficulties in emotion recognition and a number of interventions have been designed to target these problems. However, few emotion training interventions have been trialled with young children with autism and co-morbid ID. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an emotion training programme for a group of young children with autism with a range of intellectual ability.
METHODS Participants were 55 children with autistic disorder, aged 4-7 years (FSIQ 42-107). Children were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 28) or control group (n = 27). Participants in the intervention group watched a DVD designed to teach emotion recognition skills to children with autism (the Transporters), whereas the control group watched a DVD of Thomas the Tank Engine. Participants were assessed on their ability to complete basic emotion recognition tasks, mindreading and theory of mind (TOM) tasks before and after the 4-week intervention period, and at 3-month follow-up.
RESULTS Analyses controlled for the effect of chronological age, verbal intelligence, gender and DVD viewing time on outcomes. Children in the intervention group showed improved performance in the recognition of anger compared with the control group, with few improvements maintained at 3-month follow-up. There was no generalisation of skills to TOM or social skills.
CONCLUSIONS The Transporters programme showed limited efficacy in teaching basic emotion recognition skills to young children with autism with a lower range of cognitive ability. Improvements were limited to the recognition of expressions of anger, with poor maintenance of these skills at follow-up. These findings provide limited support for the efficacy of the Transporters programme for young children with autism of a lower cognitive range.

OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of high-dose rosuvastatin monotherapy with moderate dosing combined with fenofibrate or ω-3 fatty acids on the lipoprotein subfraction profile in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia and MetS.
METHODS We previously randomised patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) > 160 and TG > 200 mg/dl to rosuvastatin monotherapy 40 mg/day (R group, n = 30) or rosuvastatin 10 mg/day combined with fenofibrate 200 mg/day (RF group, n = 30) or ω-3 fatty acids 2 g/day (Rω group, n = 30). In the present study, only patients with MetS were included (24, 23 and 24 in the R, RF and Rω groups respectively). At baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment, the lipoprotein subfraction profile was determined by polyacrylamide 3% gel electrophoresis.
RESULTS The mean LDL size was significantly increased in all groups. This change was more prominent with RF than with other treatments in parallel with its greater hypotriglyceridemic capacity (p < 0.05 compared with R and Rω). A decrease in insulin resistance by RF was also noted. Only RF significantly raised HDL-C levels (by 7.7%, p < 0.05) by increasing the cholesterol of small HDL particles.

Uncertainty remains about the optimal anti-emetic regimen for control of delayed nausea and vomiting after adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Many patients receive dexamethasone but complain of insomnia, anxiety/agitation, and indigestion. The aim was to determine if patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer prefer treatment with dexamethasone or placebo for prophylaxis against delayed nausea and vomiting, and to compare quality of life (QOL) between the two treatments. In this randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial, we compared oral dexamethasone (4 mg twice daily for 2 days) versus placebo for chemotherapy-naïve patients with breast cancer. All patients received intravenous granisetron and dexamethasone pre-chemotherapy and oral granisetron on day 2. Primary endpoints were: (i) patient preference; (ii) difference between cycles in change of QOL from days 1 to 8. Median age of the 94 women was 51 years (range 27-76): 79 received fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide and 15 received doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide. Thirteen withdrew pre-cycle 2 with no differences between arms. Of 80 patients stating a preference, 31 preferred placebo (39 %, 95 % CI: 28-50 %) and 37 (46 %, 95 % CI: 35-58 %) preferred dexamethasone; 12 had no preference. There were no differences in intensity of vomiting, nausea, or time to onset of vomiting. There was greater decrease in global QOL (p = 0.06) when patients received dexamethasone. No other symptom/QOL domains differed significantly. In conclusion, no significant difference was found in patient preference, QOL, or symptoms regardless of whether dexamethasone or placebo was used after adjuvant chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION There is an increasing amount of evidence showing that physical activity and sun exposure are effective coadjuvant treatments for patients with mild to moderate depression. However, there is a lack of information regarding patient's adherence to these recommendations in daily clinical practice.
METHODS We conducted a study including 15 depressive patients who had been under antidepressant treatment for at least one month. They wore a wrist-watch-like actimetry sensor to measure physical activity and sun exposure 24 hours a day. After one week of baseline assessment, patients were randomised into one of the two arms of the study. Patients in the experimental group received a brief note in which they were explicitly asked to increase both their physical activity level and time of sun exposure, while control group patients did not receive these explicit recommendations.
RESULTS One week after recommendations were delivered, only patients in the experimental group had increased time of sun exposure and physical activity (25.8% and 14.3%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS Depressive patients are able to follow prescribed lifestyle recommendations in the short-term.

PURPOSE We evaluated the early clinical and urodynamic results of posterior tibial nerve stimulation in patients with refractory monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS We randomly assigned 28 patients with refractory monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis to 2 equal groups. Group 1 received a weekly session of posterior tibial nerve stimulation for 12 weeks and group 2 was the placebo group. Evaluation was performed in each group at baseline and after posterior tibial nerve stimulation to compare clinical and urodynamic findings. Another clinical assessment was done 3 months after the first followup.
RESULTS The 2 groups were comparable in baseline clinical and urodynamic data. Overall, 13 patients (46.4%) had detrusor overactivity and 14 (50%) had decreased bladder capacity. After treatment 11 group 1 patients (78.6%) had a partial or full response to posterior tibial nerve stimulation but only 2 (14.3%) in group 2 had a partial response (p = 0.002). Also, the average number of wet nights in group 1 was significantly lower than at baseline (p = 0.002). All urodynamic parameters significantly improved in group 1. In contrast, the number of wet nights and urodynamic parameters did not change significantly in group 2. At 3-month followup the number of patients with a partial or full response in group 1 had decreased from 11 (78.6%) to 6 (42.9%). No change was evident in group 2.
CONCLUSIONS Posterior tibial nerve stimulation can be a viable treatment option in some patients with refractory monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis. However, deterioration in some responders with time suggests the need for maintenance protocols.

Our aim was to evaluate blood loss and early clinical outcomes in patients undergoing minimally invasive TKA using custom-fit magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based pin guides.
METHODS A prospective study in 80 patients was carried out. Patients were divided randomly into 2 equal groups. In one group, intramedullary alignment jigs were used. In the second group, custom-fit MRI-based pin guides were used. All patients received the same cemented posterior-stabilized implant through a mini-midvastus approach. The volume in the drain bottles was recorded after 48 h. Hb loss was estimated by subtracting the postoperative from the preoperative Hb level. Transfusion requirements and surgical time were recorded. Outcome measures were Knee Society Scores (KSS), knee flexion, knee swelling and pain.
RESULTS There was lower mean drainage of blood in the custom-fit group (391 ml vs. 603 ml; p < 0.0001). There was no difference in estimated loss of Hb (3.6 g/dl vs. 4.1 g/dl; n.s.) and in transfusion requirements (7.5 % vs. 10 %; n.s.). Surgical time was reduced in the custom-fit group (12 min less; p = 0.001). KSS measured at week 2, 6 and 12 showed no significant difference between groups. Knee flexion measured on days 7, 10 and at week 6, 12 and knee swelling and pain measured on days 1, 3, 10 and at week 6, 12 showed no significant difference between groups.
CONCLUSIONS Using custom-fit pin guides reduces blood drainage, but not the estimated Hb loss in minimally invasive TKA and does not affect transfusion rate. Surgical time is reduced. There is no effect on the early clinical outcomes.

23356250,"['lime juice', 'lime', 'without lime', 'with lime', 'of lime juice']","Influence of lime juice on the severity of sickle cell anemia.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The pain in sickle cell anemia (SCA) is often triggered by dehydration, acidosis, and fever that are usually due to malaria. Intake of lime juice was recently demonstrated to facilitate clearance of the malaria parasite. It was therefore sought to determine whether regular intake of lime juice will ameliorate crisis, especially recurrent bone pain.
DESIGN In this preliminary, open-labeled, randomized study, the effects of lime juice on the clinical and some laboratory characteristics of children with SCA were tested.
RESULTS Among the 113 children with SCA studied in two hospitals, the 58 receiving lime treatment had lower rates of significant painful episodes than the 55 without lime (37 versus 83 crises in 6 months, and 0.64±0.11 versus 1.51±0.34 average rates per child, p<0.001). Also, fewer subjects than the controls had significant painful episodes (50.0% versus 92.7%); febrile illness (46.6% versus 87.3%) and admission rate (3.4% versus 34.5%) (p<0.001). The mean hematocrit of the subjects (26.23±2.03%) at the end of the study was also higher, p<0.001. However, transfusion rate, presence of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and jaundice was similar. Treatment with lime did not cause any significant side-effect.
CONCLUSIONS Regular intake of lime juice may be of great therapeutic and nutritional relevance in children with SCA.

OBJECTIVE To examine the efficacy of a modular cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol relative to treatment as usual (TAU) among children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and clinically significant anxiety.
METHOD A total of 45 children (7-11 years of age) with high-functioning ASD and clinically significant anxiety were randomized to receive 16 sessions of weekly CBT or TAU for an equivalent duration. After screening, assessments were conducted at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Raters were blind to treatment condition.
RESULTS Youth receiving CBT showed substantial improvement relative to TAU on primary anxiety outcomes. Of 24 children randomized to the CBT arm, 18 (75%) were treatment responders, versus only 3 of 21 children (14%) in the TAU arm. Gains were generally maintained at 3-month follow-up for CBT responders.
CONCLUSIONS Relative to usual care, CBT adapted for anxious youth with high-functioning ASD demonstrates large effects in reducing anxiety symptoms. This study contributes to the growing literature supporting adapted CBT approaches for treating anxiety in youth with ASD.

AIM The aim of the study was to evaluate circulatory AGE-peptide levels in diabetic nephropathy and to observe the effects of thiamine (vitamin B1) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) therapy.
METHODS Type 2 diabetic patients (N.=57) were divided into two groups as ""with nephropathy"" (N.=27) and ""without nephropathy"" (N.=30). Diabetic nephropathy patients were treated with either B6 (N.=12) (250 mg/day) or B1+B6 (N.=15) (250 mg/day, each) for five months. At the beginning and the end of the experimentation period, glucose, HbA1c, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin, C-peptide, thiamine pyrophosphate, pyridoxal phosphate and AGE- peptides were measured.
RESULTS AGE-peptides were higher in the diabetic group with nephropathy than without nephropathy (P=0.005). Within five months AGE-peptides increased in the diabetic group without nephropathy (P=0.042) but not in the group with nephropathy treated either with B1+B6 or B6. In B6 treated group a substantial decrease was observed in HbA1c (P=0.033). B1+B6 or B6 treatment both caused an increase in C-peptide (P=0.006, P=0.004).
CONCLUSION Among the parameters measured, plasma AGE-peptides was the only parameter found to be higher in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients ""with nephropathy"" than ""without nephropathy"". However, patients with nephropathy treated with B1+B6 or B6 did not display any further increase in AGE-peptides within five months. Both of the treatments caused an increase in C-peptide.

High-functioning autism (HFA) is characterized by persistent impairment in social interaction despite the absence of mental retardation. Although an increasing number of group-based programs for the improvement of social skills have been described, randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate their efficacy. To compare the effect of a Social Skills Training Group-based Program (SST-GP) and a Leisure Activities Group-based Program (LA-GP) on the perception of facial emotions and quality of life (QoL) in young people with HFA. Eligible patients were children and adolescents with HFA. Participants were randomized to the SST or LA group. The primary outcome was defined as an improvement of 2 points in error rates for facial emotion labeling (DANVA2) from baseline. After the 6-month training period, the SST Group made fewer errors in labeling anger on adult faces, whereas error rates in the LA Group remained stable. Progress in the ability to recognize anger in the SST Group was due to better recognition of low intensity stimuli on adult faces. QoL increased in the SST Group in the dimension of school environment, as a marker of the transfer of skills acquired in the treatment setting to their use in the community. The SST-GP had higher efficacy than the LA-GP. Data justify replication using larger samples.

IMPORTANCE There are no known effective treatments for painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.
OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of duloxetine, 60 mg daily, on average pain severity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial at 8 National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded cooperative research networks that enrolled 231 patients who were 25 years or older being treated at community and academic settings between April 2008 and March 2011. Study follow-up was completed July 2012. Stratified by chemotherapeutic drug and comorbid pain risk, patients were randomized to receive either duloxetine followed by placebo or placebo followed by duloxetine. Eligibility required that patients have grade 1 or higher sensory neuropathy according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and at least 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, representing average chemotherapy-induced pain, after paclitaxel, other taxane, or oxaliplatin treatment.
INTERVENTIONS The initial treatment consisted of taking 1 capsule daily of either 30 mg of duloxetine or placebo for the first week and 2 capsules of either 30 mg of duloxetine or placebo daily for 4 additional weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary hypothesis was that duloxetine would be more effective than placebo in decreasing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain. Pain severity was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form ""average pain"" item with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing as bad as can be imagined.
RESULTS Individuals receiving duloxetine as their initial 5-week treatment reported a mean decrease in average pain of 1.06 (95% CI, 0.72-1.40) vs 0.34 (95% CI, 0.01-0.66) among those who received placebo (P = .003; effect size, 0.513). The observed mean difference in the average pain score between duloxetine and placebo was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.26-1.20). Fifty-nine percent of those initially receiving duloxetine vs 38% of those initially receiving placebo reported decreased pain of any amount.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Among patients with painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, the use of duloxetine compared with placebo for 5 weeks resulted in a greater reduction in pain.

It is encouraging that children with autism show a strong response to early intervention, yet more research is needed for understanding the variability in responsiveness to specialized programs. Treatment predictor variables from 47 teachers and children who were randomized to receive the COMPASS intervention (Ruble et al. in The collaborative model for promoting competence and success for students with ASD. Springer, New York, 2012a) were analyzed. Predictors evaluated against child IEP goal attainment included child, teacher, intervention practice, and implementation practice variables based on an implementation science framework (Dunst and Trivette in J Soc Sci 8:143-148, 2012). Findings revealed one child (engagement), one teacher (exhaustion), two intervention quality (IEP quality for targeted and not targeted elements), and no implementation quality variables accounted for variance in child outcomes when analyzed separately. When the four significant variables were compared against each other in a single regression analysis, IEP quality accounted for one quarter of the variance in child outcomes.

OBJECTIVE We present a novel Bayesian adaptive comparative effectiveness trial comparing three treatments for status epilepticus that uses adaptive randomization with potential early stopping.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING The trial will enroll 720 unique patients in emergency departments and uses a Bayesian adaptive design.
RESULTS The trial design is compared to a trial without adaptive randomization and produces an efficient trial in which a higher proportion of patients are likely to be randomized to the most effective treatment arm while generally using fewer total patients and offers higher power than an analogous trial with fixed randomization when identifying a superior treatment.
CONCLUSION When one treatment is superior to the other two, the trial design provides better patient care, higher power, and a lower expected sample size.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of CCND1 A870G and acute adverse events (AEs) in postoperative rectal cancer patients who received capecitabine-based postoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT).
METHODS Four hundred patients with stage II and III rectal cancer received postoperative CRT of capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin were accumulated and prostectively studied in this study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. Two hundred and twenty-eight patients were treated with concurrent capecitabine and radiotherapy (Cap-CRT), and 172 patients were treated with capecitabine and oxaliplatin plus radiotherapy (Cap-Oxa-CRT). Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v. 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0). The genotype of CCND1 A870G in the patients was detected by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. The associations between the SNP and acute AEs were indicated by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which were computed with logistic regression model.
RESULTS A total of 136 patients presented severe AEs. Among them the frequencies of the three genotypes GG, GA and AA were 16.9%, 50.7% and 32.4%, compared with 24.6%, 48.1% and 27.3%, respectively, among the patients without severe AEs. Diarrhea was the most common AE, and severe diarrhea occurred in 109 patients. The frequencies of the three genotypes GG, GA and AA were 15.6%, 47.7% and 36.7% among these patients, compared with 24.4%, 49.5% and 26.1%, respectively, among patients without severe diarrhea. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a 1.66-fold increased risk for severe diarrhea in patients with AA genotype (95%CI 1.03 - 2.67, P = 0.038) compared with the cases with GG or GA genotypes. Stratified analysis showed that in the Cap-Oxa-CRT group, patients with AA genotype showed a 2.34-fold increased risk for severe diarrhea (95%CI 1.16 - 4.76, P = 0.018) compared with those with GG or GA genotypes, but in the Cap-CRT group, the SNP was not associated with the risk of severe diarrhea.
CONCLUSIONS The genetic polymorphism of CCND1 A870G might be a potential biomarker for predicting acute AEs in postoperative stage II and III rectal cancer patients treated with adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy of capecitabine and oxaliplatin.

We previously reported results based on the examination of a gluten- and casein-free diet as an intervention for children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder as part of the ScanBrit collaboration. Analysis based on grouped results indicated several significant differences between dietary and non-dietary participants across various core and peripheral areas of functioning. Results also indicated some disparity in individual responses to dietary modification potentially indicative of responder and non-responder differences. Further examination of the behavioural and psychometric data garnered from participants was undertaken, with a view to determining potential factors pertinent to response to dietary intervention. Participants with clinically significant scores indicative of inattention and hyperactivity behaviours and who had a significant positive changes to said scores were defined as responders to the dietary intervention. Analyses indicated several factors to be potentially pertinent to a positive response to dietary intervention in terms of symptom presentation. Chronological age was found to be the strongest predictor of response, where those participants aged between 7 and 9 years seemed to derive most benefit from dietary intervention. Further analysis based on the criteria for original study inclusion on the presence of the urine compound, trans-indolyl-3-acryloylglycine may also merit further investigation. These preliminary observations on potential best responder characteristics to a gluten- and casein-free diet for children with autism require independent replication.

BACKGROUNDS/AIMS Elevated triglyceride levels seem to predispose to the earlier development and accelerated progression of coronary artery disease. In our study, we assessed for the first time whether simvastatin treatment affects coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia.
METHODS The study included 39 patients with elevated triglyceride levels and peripheral artery sclerosis, treated for 90 days with either simvastatin (40 mg daily) or placebo. Plasma lipids, glucose homeostasis markers and hemostasic variables were assessed at baseline and after treatment.
RESULTS Simvastatin, but not placebo, administered to these patients reduced plasma levels/activity of fibrinogen (from 3.5 ± 0.4 to 2.8 ± 0.3 g/l, p < 0.01), factor VII (from 144.2 ± 16.9 to 112.5 ± 14.0%, p < 0.01) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (from 76.9 ± 13.5 to 50.2 ± 9.2 ng/ml, p < 0.001), without a significant reduction in von Willebrand factor levels, and tended to prolong the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times.
CONCLUSION Our results suggest that statin treatment produces a multidirectional effect on coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia and that this treatment may bring some benefits to patients with elevated triglyceride levels.

Compared were the effects of (control) syringe irrigation, (1) CanalBrush, (2) passive ultrasonic irrigation, (3) EndoActivator, and (4) RinsEndo on the removal of the sealer. The specimens were divided into four groups (N = 12) and one control group (N = 5) via randomization. The amount of remaining sealer in the root canal irregularities was evaluated under a microscope using a 4-grade scoring system, whereas the remaining sealer on the root canal surface was evaluated with a 7-grade scoring system.
RESULTS Passive ultrasonic irrigation is more effective than the other tested irrigation systems or syringe irrigation in removing sealer from root canal walls (p < 0.01). None of the techniques had a significant effect on cleaning the lateral grooves.
CONCLUSIONS Within the limitations of this study protocol ultrasonic irrigation shows a superior effect on sealer removal from the root canal surface during endodontic retreatment. Cleaning of lateral grooves seems not to be possible with one of the techniques investigated.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE Incomplete removal of root canal sealer during re-treatment may cause treatment failure. Passive Ultrasonic irrigation seems to be the most effective system to remove sealer from a root canal.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of risperidone in treating irritability and related behaviors in children and adolescents with autistic disorders.
METHODS In this 6 month (26 week) open-label extension (OLE) study, patients (5-17 years of age, who completed the previous fixed-dose, 6 week, double-blind [DB] phase) were flexibly dosed with risperidone based on body weight. The maximum allowed dose was 1.25 mg/day for those weighing 20 to <45 kg, and 1.75 mg/day for those weighing ≥ 45 kg. The study primarily assessed risperidone's safety; efficacy was assessed as a secondary end-point.
RESULTS Fifty-six (71%) out of 79 enrolled patients completed the OLE; the most common discontinuations were for insufficient response (7 [9%]) or adverse events (AE) (5 [6%]). The most common (≥ 5% frequency in the total group) AEs were increased appetite (11% [n=9]); increased weight and vomiting (9% [n=7] each); sedation, pyrexia, and upper respiratory tract infection (8% [n=6] each); nasopharyngitis (6% [n=5]); and somnolence and fatigue (5% [n=4] each). Extrapyramidal AEs were reported in 6 (8%) patients. Increase in mean weight (11-15%) and body mass index (5-10%) occurred; one patient discontinued because of weight increase. One potentially prolactin-related AE (irregular menstruation) was reported. The risperidone high-dose group had the greatest mean improvement in sleep visual analog scale (24.6). All groups showed additional improvement in efficacy scale scores during the OLE.
CONCLUSIONS During this OLE, safety findings with risperidone treatment (maximum weight-based dose of 1.25 mg/day or 1.75 mg/day) were consistent with those observed in the DB phase, and with the current safety information for risperidone in autistic, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) share brain function abnormalities during cognitive flexibility. Serotonin is involved in both disorders, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can modulate cognitive flexibility and improve behavior in both disorders. Thus, this study investigates shared and disorder-specific brain dysfunctions in these 2 disorders during reward reversal, and the acute effects of an SSRI on these. Age-matched boys with ADHD (15), ASD (18), and controls (21) were compared with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a reversal task. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of Fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized design. Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects. Patients under each drug condition were compared with controls to assess normalization effects. fMRI data showed that, under placebo, ASD boys underactivated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), compared with control and ADHD boys. Both patient groups shared decreased precuneus activation. Under Fluoxetine, mPFC activation was up-regulated and normalized in ASD boys relative to controls, but down-regulated in ADHD boys relative to placebo, which was concomitant with worse task performance in ADHD. Fluoxetine therefore has inverse effects on mPFC activation in ASD and ADHD during reversal learning, suggesting dissociated underlying serotonin abnormalities.

OBJECTIVE To estimate the associations between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnoses and service use, caregiver time, and cost outcomes.
METHODS We used national data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey linked to the National Health Interview Survey and a study-specific survey to estimate the annual utilization and costs for health care, school, ASD-related therapy, family-coordinated services, as well as caregiver time in children aged 3 to 17 years, with and without parent-reported ASD. Regression analyses estimated the association between ASD diagnosis and cost, controlling for child gender, age, race/ethnicity, insurance status, household income, country region and urban/rural classification, and non-ASD-related illnesses.
RESULTS Children with parent-reported ASD had higher levels of health care office visits and prescription drug use compared with children without ASD (P < .05). A greater proportion of children in the ASD group used special educational services (76% vs. 7% in the control group, P < .05). After adjusting for child demographic characteristics and non-ASD-associated illnesses, ASD was associated with $3020 (95% confidence interval [CI]: $1017-$4259) higher health care costs and $14,061 (95% CI: $4390-$24,302) higher aggregate non-health care costs, including $8610 (95% CI: $6595-$10,421) higher school costs. In adjusted analyses, parents who reported that their child had ASD did not have significantly higher out-of-pocket costs or spend more time on caregiving activities compared with control parents.
CONCLUSIONS The economic burden associated with ASD is substantial and can be measured across multiple sectors of our society. Previous analyses that focused on health care underestimated this economic burden, particularly for school systems.

BACKGROUND In COPD patients, reversibility is currently evaluated from the changes of forced expiratory volume at 1s (ΔFEV1) and forced vital capacity (ΔFVC). By lowering peripheral airway smooth muscle tone, bronchodilators should decrease dynamic hyperinflation, gas trapping, and possibly dyspnea at rest. Hence, we hypothesize that specific airway resistance changes (ΔsRAW) should better characterize the acute response to bronchodilators.
METHODS On two days, 60 COPD patients underwent dyspnea evaluation (VAS score) and pulmonary function testing at baseline and one hour after placebo or 300μg indacaterol administration.
RESULTS Spirographic and ΔsRAW-based criteria identified as responders 24 and 45 patients, respectively. ΔsRAW correlated with changes of intrathoracic gas volume (ΔITGV) (r=0.61; p<0.001), residual volume (ΔRV) (r=0.60; p<0.001), ΔFVC (r=0.44; p=0.001), and ΔVAS (r=0.73; p<0.001), while ΔFEV1 correlated only with ΔFVC (r=0.34; p=0.008). Significant differences in terms of ΔITGV (p=0.002), ΔRV (p=0.023), and ΔVAS (p<0.001) occurred only if patients were stratified according to ΔsRAW.
CONCLUSIONS In assessing the acute functional effect of bronchodilators, ΔsRAW-based criterion is preferable to FEV1-FVC-based criteria, being more closely related to bronchodilator-induced improvements of lung mechanics and dyspnea at rest.

BACKGROUND The choice of a molecular test for first intention determination of paternal RHD zygosity, before entering into invasive diagnostics, is important for the management of pregnancies at risk of haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn related to anti-RhD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS RHD zygosity was evaluated in 370 RH:1 Tunisian donors by polymerase chain reaction - sequence-specific polymorphism (PCR-SSP) analysis and polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) amplification of hybrid Rhesus box and by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) specific for RHD exon 5. To evaluate the accuracy of molecular tests in the cases of discordant results, the ten exons of RHD and Rhesus boxes were amplified by PCR and sequenced.
RESULTS Molecular investigations revealed that our 370 donors comprise 193 dizygous and 145 hemizygous individuals and 32 subjects whose zygosity remains unknown. Positive predictive values were higher than 99% for all the methods, reaching 100% for RQ-PCR. Negative predictive values were 83.24%, 87.27% and 98% for PCR-SSP, PCR-RFLP and RQ-PCR respectively. This study also revealed 19 novel Rhesus box polymorphisms and three novel RHD alleles: RHD(Trp185Stop), RHD(Ala176Thr) and RHD(Ile342Ile).
DISCUSSION RQ-PCR is the most convenient method for first intention determination of paternal RHD zygosity in Tunisians. However, taking into account positive and negative predictive values, PCR-RFLP could be an alternative despite the heterogeneity of Rhesus boxes and the complexity of RHD.

BACKGROUND Social skills training (SST) is a common intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) to improve their social and communication skills. Despite the fact that SSTs are often applied in clinical practice, the evidence for the effectiveness of these trainings for children with ASD is inconclusive. Moreover, long term outcome and generalization of learned skills are little evaluated. Additionally, there is no research on the influence of involvement of parents and teachers on effectiveness of SST and on the generalization of learned social skills to daily life. We expect parent and teacher involvement in SST to enhance treatment efficacy and to facilitate generalization of learned skills to daily life.
METHOD/DESIGN In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three conditions, 120 participants with ASD at the end of primary school (10-12 years of calendar age) have been randomized to SST, SST-PTI (SST with Parent & Teacher Involvement), or care-as-usual. The SST consists of 18 group sessions of 1.5 hours for the children. In the SST-PTI condition, parents additionally participate in 8 parent sessions and parents and teachers are actively involved in homework assignments. Assessment takes place at three moments: before and immediately after the intervention period and at 6 months follow-up. Primary outcome is socialization, as an aspect of adaptive functioning. Secondary outcomes focus on specific social skills children learn during SST and on more general social skills pertaining to home and community settings from a multi-informant perspective. Additionally, possible predictors of treatment outcome will be assessed.
DISCUSSION The current study is an RCT study evaluating SST in a large sample of Dutch children with ASD in a specific age range (10-12 years). Strengths of the study are the use of one manualized protocol, application of standardized and internationally used rating instruments, use of multiple raters, investigation of generalization of learned skills to daily life, and the evaluation of efficacy in the longer term by follow-up measures at 6 months after the end of training.

A new heptavalent conjugate vaccine (PCV7-TT) is under development in Cuba. PCV7-TT contains 2 μg of serotypes 1, 5, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F and 4 μg of 6B, each one conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT). This vaccine was designed with the serotypes that cause most invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) worldwide. In the present study, we investigated the safety and explored the immunogenicity of PCV7-TT during a controlled, randomized and double blind clinical trial phase I in 4-5-year-old children. PCV7-TT was well tolerated and as safe as Synflorix used as control vaccine. Following a single-dose vaccination, all individual serotypes included in PCV7-TT induced statistically significant increase of IgG GMC and OPA GMT. These are the first clinical results of PCV7-TT in children and they pave the way toward next clinical trials in children and infants. This clinical trial was published in the Cuban Public Register of Clinical Trials with code RPCEC00000173.

UNLABELLED Abstract Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the short-term treatment effects of atomoxetine on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms in children and adolescents with both ASD and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
METHODS A total of 97 patients 6-17 years of age, with ASD and ADHD, were treated with 1.2 mg/kg/day of atomoxetine during an 8 week double-blind placebo-controlled period. Here, we investigated effects on two parent-based secondary outcome measures, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Children's Social Behavior Questionnaire (CSBQ).
RESULTS After 8 weeks of double-blind treatment, atomoxetine administration was associated with significant treatment effects on the ABC subscales Hyperactivity, Inappropriate Speech, and Stereotypic Behavior, and on the CSBQ subscale Fear for Changes.
CONCLUSIONS Our study results indicate no beneficial effects of atomoxetine on social functioning. However, atomoxetine may ameliorate restricted and stereotyped behaviors and communication.

BACKGROUND About one third of patients prescribed blood pressure or lipid-lowering drugs for the prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke do not take their medication as prescribed. We conducted a randomized trial to evaluate text messaging as a means of improving adherence to cardiovascular disease preventive treatment.
METHODS 303 patients taking blood pressure and/or lipid-lowering medications were randomly assigned to being sent text messages (Text group, 151) or not being sent them (No text group, 152). Texts were sent daily for 2 weeks, alternate days for 2 weeks and weekly thereafter for 22 weeks (6 months overall), using an automated computer programme. Patients were asked to respond on whether they had taken their medication, whether the text reminded them to do so if they had forgotten, and if they had not taken their medication to determine if there was a reason for not doing so. At 6 months, use of medication was assessed.
RESULTS Two patients were lost to follow-up, providing data on 301 for analysis. In the No text group 38/151 (25%) took less than 80% of the prescribed regimen (ie. stopped medication completely or took it on fewer than 22 of the last 28 days of follow-up) compared to 14/150 patients (9%) in the Text group - an improvement in adherence affecting 16 per 100 patients (95% CI 7 to 24), p<0.001. The texts reminded 98/151 patients (65%) to take medication on at least one occasion and lead to 20/151 (13%) who stopped taking medication because of concern over efficacy or side-effects, resuming treatment.
CONCLUSIONS In patients taking blood pressure or lipid-lowering treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, text messaging improved medication adherence compared with no text messaging.

BACKGROUND Public-health guidelines recommend patients with congenital heart disease to exercise. Studies have shown that patients with congenital heart disease can improve physical exercise capacity. The effect of training on regional ventricular performance has hardly been studied. We performed a pilot study to assess whether an exercise training program would result in adverse changes of regional ventricular performance in patients with corrected tetralogy of Fallot.
METHODS AND RESULTS Multicenter prospective randomized controlled pilot study in patients with tetralogy of Fallot aged 10 to 25 years. A 12-week standardized aerobic dynamic exercise training program (3 one-hour sessions per week) was used. Pre- and post-training cardiopulmonary exercise tests, MRI, and echocardiography, including tissue-Doppler imaging, were performed. Patients were randomized to the exercise group (n=28) or control group (n=20). One patient in the exercise group dropped out. Change in tissue-Doppler imaging parameters was similar in the exercise group and control group (change in right ventricle free wall peak velocity E' exercise group, 0.8±2.6 cm/s; control group, 0.9±4.1; peak velocity A' exercise group, 0.4±2.4 m/s; control group 4.6±18.1 cm/s).
CONCLUSIONS This randomized controlled pilot study provides preliminary data suggesting that regional ventricular performance is well maintained during 3-month aerobic dynamic exercise training in children and young adults with repaired tetralogy of Fallot. This information might help patients adhere to current public-health guidelines.

INTRODUCTION The aims of the present study were: (a) to examine the agreement between subjective (assessed via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire; IPAQ) and objective (accelerometry; GT3X) physical activity (PA) levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and (b) to evaluate the associations of RA patients' subjective and objective PA to their scores on the maximal oxygen uptake test (VO2max).
METHODS The participants wore the GT3X for seven days before completing the IPAQ and VO2max test. The Bland-Altman plot was used to illustrate the agreement between the objective and subjective PA data, and the Wilcoxon test was employed to examine the differences. The association between the PA measurement and VO2max test was examined via the correlations and the magnitude was presented by the Steiger's Z value.
RESULTS Sixty-eight RA patients (age=55±13 years, body mass index: 27.8±5.4 kg/m2, median of disease duration=5 (2-8) yrs) were recruited. Smaller differences between the subjective and objective measures were found when PA was assessed at the moderate level. Wilcoxon tests revealed that patients reported less time spent engaged in sedentary behaviours (Z=-6.80, P<0.01) and light PA (Z=-6.89, P<0.01) and more moderate PA (Z=-6.26, P<0.01) than was objectively indicated. Significant positive correlations were revealed between VO2max with all PA levels derived from accelerometry (light PA rho=.35, P<.01; moderate PA rho=.34, P=.01; moderate and vigorous PA, (MVPA) rho=.33, P=.01), and a negative association to sedentary time (ST) emerged (rho=-.27, P=.04). IPAQ-reported moderate PA and MVPA positively correlated with maxV02 (rho=.25, P=.01, rho=.27, P=.01, respectively). Differences between the magnitude of correlations between the IPAQ-VO2 max and GT3X-VO2 max were only significant for ST (Z=3.43, P<.01).
CONCLUSIONS Via responses to the IPAQ, RA patients reported that they were less sedentary and engaged in more higher intensity PA than what was objectively assessed. Accelerometry data correlated with VO2max at all PA levels. Only subjective moderate and MPVA correlated with VO2max. Findings suggest that self-reported PA and ST should be interpreted with caution in people with RA and complemented with accelerometry when possible.

BACKGROUND In Australia, bowel cancer screening participation using faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) is low. Decision support tailored to psychological predictors of participation may increase screening. The study compared tailored computerised decision support to non-tailored computer or paper information. The primary outcome was FOBT return within 12 weeks. Additional analyses were conducted on movement in decision to screen and change on psychological variables.
METHODS A parallel, randomised controlled, trial invited 25,511 people aged 50-74 years to complete an eligibility questionnaire. Eligible respondents (n = 3,408) were assigned to Tailored Personalised Decision Support (TPDS), Non-Tailored PDS (NTPDS), or Control (CG) (intention-to-treat, ITT sample). TPDS and NTPDS groups completed an on-line baseline survey (BS) and accessed generic information. The TPDS group additionally received a tailored intervention. CG participants completed a paper BS only. Those completing the BS (n = 2270) were mailed an FOBT and requested to complete an endpoint survey (ES) that re-measured BS variables (per-protocol, PP sample).
RESULTS FOBT return: In the ITT sample, there was no significant difference between any group (χ (2)(2) = 2.57, p = .26; TPDS, 32.5%; NTPDS, 33%; and CG, 34.5%). In the PP sample, FOBT return in the internet groups was significantly higher than the paper group (χ (2)(2) = 17.01, p < .001; TPDS, 80%; NTPDS, 83%; and CG, 74%). FOBT completion by TPDS and NTPDS did not differ (χ (2)(1) = 2.23, p = .13). Age was positively associated with kit return. Decision to screen: 2227/2270 of the PP sample provided complete BS data. Participants not wanting to screen at baseline (1083/2227) and allocated to TPDS and NTPDS were significantly more likely to decide to screen and return an FOBT than those assigned to the CG. FOBT return by TPDS and NTPDS did not differ from one another (OR = 1.16, p = .42). Change on psychosocial predictors: Analysis of change indicated that salience and coherence of screening and self-efficacy were improved and faecal aversion decreased by tailored messaging.
CONCLUSIONS Online information resources may have a role in encouraging internet-enabled people who are uncommitted to screening to change their attitudes, perceptions and behaviour.

OBJECTIVE Different regimens are used for sedation during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Our objectives were to compare safety, ease of treatment, recovery, and patients' experiences using patient-controlled sedation (PCS) with propofol, nurse anesthetist-controlled sedation (ACS), or the department's standard of care, midazolam given by the procedure team (control group).
MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 281 adults in 301 procedures. The PCS group (n = 101) delivered bolus doses of 5 mg of propofol according to their need for sedation. The ACS group (n = 100) had 2-8 mg/kg/h of propofol infused, with the target for sedation being level 3 of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale. The control group was given 2-3 mg of midazolam for induction and additional 1 mg if required.
RESULTS PCS and ACS increased the ease of the procedure and reduced the number of sedation failures compared to midazolam sedation (ACS n = 0; PCS n = 4; midazolam n = 20). The ACS group had more deeply sedated patients (OAA/S level 2), desaturation, and obstructed airways than the PCS and midazolam groups. Time to full recovery (Aldrete score ≥9) was shortest following PCS. PCS resulted in the least fatigue and pain after the procedure. Patients' preference for PCS and ACS was the same.
CONCLUSION PCS with propofol is superior to midazolam and comparable to ACS. PCS resulted in a rapid recovery, fewer respiratory events, and was almost as effective as ACS in ensuring a successful examination.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate and compare the effects of preoperative oral pregabalin and perioperative intravenous lidocaine infusion on postoperative morphine requirement, adverse effects, patients' satisfaction, mobilization, time to first defecation and time to discharge in patients undergoing laparotomy.
METHODS Eighty patients (18 to 65 years of age) undergoing elective laparotomy were randomly divided into four groups (n=20 in each group): group C, placebo capsules and normal saline infusion perioperatively (control); group L, placebo capsules and lidocaine 1 mg⁄kg intravenous bolus dose followed by 2 mg⁄kg⁄h infusion until skin closure; group P, 150 mg oral pregabalin and normal saline infusion perioperatively; and group PL, 150&nbsp;mg oral pregabalin and lidocaine 2 mg⁄kg⁄h infusion until skin closure. Hemodynamic parameters, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, analgesic consumption, side effects, time to mobilization, time to first defecation, time to discharge and patients' satisfaction were recorded.
RESULTS VAS scores of group L, group P and group PL were lower than group C (P<0.05). Morphine consumption of group P and group PL was lower than group C (P<0.05). Incidence of nausea in group C was higher than group L and group PL. Time to first defecation and mobilization were shorter in group L and group PL compared with group C (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION Preoperative oral pregabalin and perioperative intravenous lidocaine infusion decreased postoperative VAS scores. Preoperative oral pregabalin decreased morphine requirement and perioperative intravenous lidocaine infusion hastened gastrointestinal motility and mobilization, and decreased the incidence of nausea in patients undergoing laparotomy. Therefore, preoperative pregabalin with or without lidocaine provides superior pain relief in patients undergoing laparatomy.

OBJECTIVE To develop a clinically valid interactive level 2 screening assessment for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in toddlers that is brief, easily administered, and scored by clinicians.
STUDY DESIGN We describe the development, training, standardization, and validation of the Rapid Interactive Screening Test for Autism in Toddlers (RITA-T) with ASD-specific diagnostic instruments. The RITA-T can be administered and scored in 10 minutes. We studied the validity of the RITA-T to distinguish between toddlers with ASD from toddlers with developmental delay (DD)/non-ASD in an early childhood clinic. We also evaluated the test's performance in toddlers with no developmental concerns. We identified a cutoff score based on sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the RITA-T that best differentiates between ASD and DD/non-ASD.
RESULTS A total of 61 toddlers were enrolled. RITA-T scores were correlated with ASD-specific diagnostic tools (r = 0.79; P < .01) and ASD clinical diagnoses (r = 0.77; P < .01). Mean scores were significantly different in subjects with ASD, those with DD/non-ASD, and those with no developmental concerns (20.8 vs 13 vs 10.6, respectively; P < .0001). At a cutoff score of >14 , the RITA-T had a sensitivity of 1.00, specificity of 0.84, and positive predictive value of 0.88 for identifying ASD risk in a high-risk group.
CONCLUSION The RITA-T is a promising new level 2 interactive screening tool for improving the early identification of ASD in toddlers in general pediatric and early intervention settings and allowing access to treatment.

OBJECTIVE Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with poor insight has severe consequences for patients; nonetheless, no randomized controlled trial has ever been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of any treatment specifically for poor-insight OCD. A new psychotherapy for OCD, the inference-based approach (IBA), targets insight in OCD by strengthening normal sensory-driven reality testing. The goal of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of this new treatment to the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for patients with OCD with poor insight.
METHOD A randomized controlled trial was conducted, in which 90 patients with OCD with poor insight received either 24 CBT sessions or 24 IBA sessions. The primary outcome measure was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). Secondary outcome measures were level of insight, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and quality of life. Mixed-effects models were used to determine the treatment effect.
RESULTS In both conditions, a significant OCD symptom reduction was reached, but no condition effects were established. Post hoc, in a small subgroup of patients with the worst insight (n = 23), it was found that the patients treated with the IBA reached a significantly higher OCD symptom reduction than the patients treated with CBT [estimated marginal mean = -7.77, t(219.45) = -2.4, p = 0.017].
CONCLUSION Patients with OCD with poor insight improve significantly after psychological treatment. The results of this study suggest that both CBT and the IBA are effective treatments for OCD with poor insight. The IBA might be more promising than CBT for patients with more extreme poor insight.

All data were subjected to covariance analysis including the age factor. Plasma catecholamine concentrations remained within the normal range during the investigation in patients subjected to general anaesthesia (Groups 1-3). Plasma catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) increased significantly in Group 4 (retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia). There were no group variabilities with regard to MAP and HR. The plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine demonstrate a direct response to stress followed by a secondary change in glucose, lactate and free glycerol.

The etiology of postoperative deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is thought to be due to a combination of factors including stasis, a hypercoagulable state and venous endothelial damage. Methods of prophylaxis are directed toward correcting one or more of these pathologic events. Methods counteracting more than one of these factors can be expected to be even more effective. The combination of dihydroergotamine (DHE) and heparin was anticipated to minimize stasis and the hypercoagulable state respectively. Based upon current experimental evidence and current theory, an additional benefit might include minimizing venous endothelial injury by controlling venomotor tone. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial was designed and performed in the United States evaluating the prophylactic efficacy of DHE 0.5 mg plus heparin 5000 U, DHE 0.5 mg plus heparin 2500 U, heparin 5000 U, and DHE 0.5 mg versus placebo.

From this study there emerged the value of combined therapy using doxorubicine as much because of the frequency with which results better than 50% were obtained (in a randomised trial) as by their quality, which was made clear in an important series of 240 cases. They point out the conditions required to initiate the place of such a scheme in all complex therapy which aims as much at palliation as at cure, and point out how important it is to be methodical in the application of chemotherapy in order to ensure its development as an anticancer therapy.

Near normoglycaemia was achieved with continuous infusion and multiple injections but not with conventional treatment. Blind evaluation of fluorescein angiograms performed three monthly showed progression of retinopathy in the control group, transient deterioration in the continuous infusion group, and no change in the multiple injection group. Half the patients receiving continuous infusion and multiple injections developed retinal cotton wool spots after three to six months. These changes regressed in all but four patients after 12 months. Control patients did not develop cotton wool spots. Patients who developed cotton wool spots are characterised by a larger decrement in glycosylated haemoglobin and blood glucose values, more frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, a longer duration of diabetes, and more severe retinopathy at onset. A large and rapid fall in blood glucose concentration may promote transient deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.

Sodium cromoglycate was superior to placebo in improving breathlessness at rest (p less than 0.001), breathlessness on exertion (p less than 0.05) and the quality of sleep (p less than 0.001), and also in improving the morning peak expiratory flow rate value (p less than 0.05). Both the patients' (p less than 0.05) and the clinicians' (p less than 0.01) treatment opinions, and their treatment preferences (p less than 0.05), favoured sodium cromoglycate. Moreover, usage of bronchodilators (theophylline and aerosol beta-stimulants combined) declined significantly (p less than 0.001) during sodium cromoglycate treatment compared to placebo. No side-effects were reported. The results of this study show that sodium cromoglycate delivered by pressurized aerosol was significantly superior to placebo, not only in improving asthmatic symptoms, but also in reducing the amount of concomitant bronchodilator therapy required.

To study the effects of physical exercise on biochemical risk factors for ischaemic heart disease 31 healthy middle aged men undertook regular physical exercise for two months and 29 served as controls in a randomised trial. In the men taking regular exercise serum cholesterol concentrations increased 26% more in the high density lipoprotein subfraction two (HDL2) and decreased 31% more in the subfraction three (HDL3) and 9% more in the low density lipoprotein fraction than in the control group. A tendency towards increased plasma 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha concentration and decreased serum thromboxane B2 concentration was found during the period of regular exercise, but prostaglandin E2 concentrations remained unchanged. The increase in plasma 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha concentration was associated with an increase in serum HDL2 cholesterol concentration in the group taking regular exercise. Our data suggest that mild regular physical exercise favourably influences cholesterol distribution in serum lipoproteins in healthy middle aged men and may have beneficial effects on circulating metabolites of arachidonic acid.

A blind, randomized trial of antenatal glucocorticoid treatment was conducted using the premature monkey (Macaca nemestrina) model of hyaline membrane disease (HMD). Twelve dams received dexamethasone (2 mg/dose) 72, 48, and 24 h before abdominal delivery at 135 +/- 1 days of gestation. Twelve control animals received saline. Infants of dexamethasone-treated dams had significantly lower incidence and severity of HMD than did infants of control animals (50 versus 92%, p less than 0.05). Improvement with treatment was markedly greater for males than for females. Differences in volume-pressure behavior of the excised lungs included greater distensibility in the infants from dexamethasone-treated dams (20.6 +/- 7.1 ml/g dry lung versus 14.7 +/- 6.1, p less than 0.05) and enhanced deflation stability with treatment. Accelerated production of surface active material (SAM) phospholipids in infants from dexamethasone-treated dams was indicated by increases in total lung phospholipid (84.5 +/- 8.1 mg/g dry lung versus 75.1 +/- 9.9, p less than 0.025), alveolar lavage fluid phospholipid (5.65 +/- 3.33 mg/g dry lung versus 3.01 +/- 1.84, p less than 0.05), and alveolar lavage fluid disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DPC) (2.47 +/- 1.84 mg/g dry lung versus 1.06 +/- 1.05, p less than 0.05). Incorporation of 14C-palmitate into lung lipid was not influenced by dexamethasone, but a significantly greater portion of the label appeared in the DPC fraction with treatment. Antenatal dexamethasone treatment was successful in reducing the incidence and severity of experimental HMD in this animal model; the beneficial effects of treatment were associated with accelerated maturation of fetal pulmonary functions, including, but not limited to, synthetic metabolism of SAM phospholipid.

Reduction of the proportion of linoleate by clofibrate but not by niceritrol.

The fatty acid composition of the plasma lipid esters has been studied during lipid-lowering treatment of 95 patients with atherosclerotic disease. During the first two months of the trial only a diet was prescribed. During the ensuing two months either clofibrate or niceritrol, a nicotinic acid ester, was added in a randomized order. During the last two months the second drug was added. The combined treatment with diet, clofibrate and niceritrol caused highly significant serum lipid reductions. The fatty acid composition in the plasma lipid esters was determined in samples from each trial period to measure the degree of dietary adherence. During dietary treatment the relative content of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids secreased and the polyunsaturated fatty acids increased with an increasing ratio between pulyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids (P/S ratio) in the cholesterol esters and triglycerides. Only minor changes were seen in the phospholipids. The changes caused by the diet were partly reversed by clofibrate while niceritrol did not cause any major changes of the fatty acid composition. Clofibrate treatment coincided with increasing amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids, especially oleate (18 : 1), in the cholesterol esters, triglycerides and phospholipids while there were significant reductions of the content of linoleic (18 : 2) acid in both the cholesterol esters and triglycerides. The 18 : 2/18 : 1 ratio decreased significantly in all the lipid esters analyzed. However, the P/S ratio was not significantly affected, partly because the relative content of saturated fatty acids also tended to decrease during clofibrate treatment. It is concluded that addition of clofibrate treatment to patients who are on a diet enriched with polyunsaturated fats is associated with a change from polyunsaturated to monounsaturated fatty acids in the plasma lipid esters but does not significantly effect the ratio between polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids. The fatty acid changes caused by clofibrate treatment and counteracted by an increased amount of polyunsaturated fat in the diet.

Subjects were randomized to receive i.v., one of ondansetron 4 mg, droperidol 1.25 mg, perphenazine 5 mg, metoclopramide 10 mg, or placebo prior to induction of anesthesia. Hypotension immediately after administration of metoclopramide was observed in two patients and four patients given ondansetron developed profound systolic hypotension at induction of anesthesia. Twenty-two percent of patients receiving droperidol became sedated. Postoperatively, patients developing severe nausea, retching, or vomiting, defined as severe emetic sequelae (SES), were deemed to have failed antiemetic prophylaxis and received antiemetic rescue. A significantly larger number of patients who received i.v. ondansetron (63%), droperidol (76%), and perphenazine (70%) were free of SES when compared to placebo (43%); P < 0.05. Metoclopramide was ineffective. Although ondansetron, droperidol, and perphenazine were effective in providing antiemetic prophylaxis, only i.v. perphenazine was free of side effects. Hence, we conclude that perphenazine is the best choice for antiemetic prophylaxis after TAH.

BACKGROUND Studies have shown that a majority of women with a family history of breast cancer have exaggerated perceptions of their own risk of this disease and experience excessive anxiety. In response to the need to communicate more accurate risk information to these women, specialized programs for breast cancer risk counseling have been initiated in medical centers across the United States.
PURPOSE Our purpose was 1) to evaluate the impact of a standardized protocol for individualized breast cancer risk counseling on comprehension of personal risk among first-degree relatives of index breast cancer patients and 2) to identify women most and least likely to benefit from such counseling.
METHODS This study is a prospective randomized trial comparing individualized breast cancer risk counseling to general health counseling (control). We studied 200 women aged 35 years and older who had a family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative. Women with a personal history of cancer were excluded. Risk comprehension was assessed as the concordance between perceived ""subjective"" lifetime breast cancer risk and estimated ""objective"" lifetime risk.
RESULTS The results of logistic regression analysis showed that women who received risk counseling were significantly more likely to improve their risk comprehension, compared with women in the control condition (odds ratio [OR] = 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-9.5; P = .01). However, in both groups, about two thirds of women continued to overestimate their lifetime risks substantially following counseling. Examination of subjects by treatment interaction effects indicated that risk counseling did not produce improved comprehension among the large proportion of women who had high levels of anxious preoccupation with breast cancer at base line (P = .02). In addition, white women were less likely to benefit than African-American women (OR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.11-0.99; P = .05).
CONCLUSION Efforts to counsel women about their breast cancer risks are not likely to be effective unless their breast cancer anxieties are also addressed.
IMPLICATIONS Attention to the psychological aspects of breast cancer risk will be critical in the development of risk-counseling programs that incorporate testing for the recently cloned breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1 (and BRCA2 when that gene has also been cloned).

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ketorolac tromethamine 10 mg and 30 mg suppositories in comparison to placebo, after single dose administration in patients suffering from post-operative pain after cholecystectomy.
DESIGN Double-blind, randomized, controlled study.
SETTING Anaesthesia Service.
PATIENTS 99 patients with severe pain following surgery.
INTERVENTIONS Cholecystectomy.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The analgesia activity of ketorolac tromethamine 10 mg and 30 mg suppositories were evaluated after single dose administration by assessing pain intensity and pain relief using a 4 point scale (VRS). At the end of the treatment period overall assessment of safety and efficacy were recorded by physician and patient. The results show that in both active groups after 30' and until 4 hours, pain intensity decreased significantly with respect to the baseline. However a statistically significant difference between groups of p < 0.02, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 was found in favour of the 30 mg dose respectively at 30', 6 and 8 hours after administration. All the patients treated with placebo suppositories required another rescue analgesic drug and withdrew from the trial. Three patients complained adverse events not related to treatment: two on placebo and one on ketorolac 10 mg. The systemic and local tolerability of the drug was good.
CONCLUSIONS This study shows that ketorolac 30 mg suppositories are effective in clinical conditions, such as after surgery, in which pain control must be achieved within the shortest time interval and maintained or improved by means of a single route of administration.

International guidelines for the management of hypertension--including the Fifth Report of the Joint National Committee, the 1993 report of the World Health Organization and the International Society of Hypertension and the second report of the British Hypertension Society Working Party--have all been modified to reflect the emerging evidence concerning the benefits of treating older patients.

BACKGROUND Transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide (TLCO) was measured by a new method based on analysis of the ratio of the concentrations of carbon monoxide to an inert gas (methane) relative to lung volume during a constant exhalation. Since this new technique is based solely upon exhalation, anomalies associated with inspiration and breath holding do not affect results. Additionally, because prolonged breath holding is not required, measurements can readily be made in dyspnoeic patients.
METHODS Exhalation TLCO (TLCO,ex) was compared with the standard (Jones and Meade) 10 second breath holding TLCO (TLCO,bh) in 100 consecutive patients. Patients did not practise the exhalation manoeuvre prior to testing.
RESULTS The comparative results were very close; mean difference (bias) +/- standard deviation (precision) was 0.05 (0.84) mmol/min/kPa. The relation was equally strong in patients with severe pulmonary disease; for patients with FEV1 < 1.51 the mean difference was 0.21 (0.80) mmol/min/kPa.
CONCLUSIONS Since the results were essentially identical between the techniques, it seems that comparable pathophysiological factors affect TLCO during breath holding and constant exhalation. Constant exhalation may therefore be a useful alternative to the breath holding technique for clinical measurement of TLCO.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Thoracotomy is associated with pain and compromised pulmonary function. Intercostal nerve blocks (INB) and subarachnoid morphine (SM) act on different portions of the pain pathway. Each is effective for post-thoracotomy pain relief. The combination of these two modalities in relieving post-thoracotomy pain and improving postoperative pulmonary function has not been investigated.
METHODS In a double-blind study, 20 patients undergoing lateral thoracotomy for lung resection were randomized to receive 0.5 mg SM preoperatively and INB with bupivacaine (INB+) prior to wound closure or 0.5 mg SM with INB using saline (INB-). Visual analog scale pain scores at rest, with cough, and with movement of the ipsilateral arm, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the operation. Opioid use was measured during the initial 24 hours after the operation.
RESULTS At 4 hours, the INB+ group demonstrated better FEV1 (56.6% vs. 40.4% of baseline, P < .05) and FVC values (54.6% vs. 39.6% of baseline, P < .05) and less resting and cough pain (P < .05). However, FEV1 continued to decline in the INB+ group at 24 hours to lower than the INB- group although pain scores were similar beyond 4 hours. Opioid usage during the first 24 hours was similar (INB-, 16.7 mg vs. INB+, 13.2 mg, P = .7).
CONCLUSIONS Although postoperative INB provided modest improvements in pain and pulmonary function when used as an adjuvant to 0.5 mg SM for post-thoracotomy analgesia, the benefits were transient. The authors do not recommend adding INB for patients undergoing lateral thoracotomy who receive 0.5 mg SM.

Fluoroscopy is a reliable, easy, and readily available technique to follow-up prosthesis functioning after heart valve surgery. The different orientation given to the prosthesis may represent a limitation of the technique accounting for unsatisfactory results in 10% to 40% of the cases. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether and to what extent different intraoperative valve orientation influence feasibility and accuracy of postoperative fluoroscopic evaluation of bileaflet prostheses. We prospectively evaluated 90 patients who had aortic, mitral, and/or tricuspid valve replacement with Sorin Bicarbon or CarboMedics bileaflet prostheses. Fifty percent of the patients in each group were randomly assigned to receive prostheses oriented in a perpendicular or a parallel position with respect to the ventricular septum. Fluoroscopic evaluation was considered appropriate when the prosthesis' ""tilting disk"" projection was obtained. The valve's hemodynamic performance was investigated through Doppler study. A proper fluoroscopic evaluation was rapidly (15 +/- 5 seconds) achieved in all patients with the former orientation, whereas it was impossible to obtain it in 8 of 20 (40%), 19 of 20 (95%), and 4 of 5 (80%) of patients with the latter orientation. In the remaining patients extremely angulated, uneasy projection was often required to get a correct fluoroscopic image. The Doppler study showed a similarly favorable hemodynamic performance regardless of valve orientation. Prosthesis orientation crucially affects the rate of success of the fluoroscopic evaluation. The orientation perpendicular to the ventricular septum greatly facilitates the postoperative feasibility and accuracy of fluoroscopy, and it is not detrimental to the valve's hemodynamic performance. This valve orientation may provide a better fluoroscopic window whenever a valve dysfunction is suspected.

METHODS Twenty drug-free adults with autistic disorder (16 men and 4 women) (mean [+/- SD] age, 30.5 +/- 8.5 years) underwent short-term tryptophan depletion in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design. Patients received a 24-hour, low-tryptophan diet followed the next morning by an amino acid drink. Behavioral ratings were obtained on the morning of the amino acid drink (baseline) and 180, 300, and 420 minutes after the drink. Plasma free and total tryptophan levels were obtained at baseline and 5 hours after the drink. The active and sham testing sessions were separated by 7 days.
RESULTS Eleven (65%) of the 17 patients who completed both test days showed a significant global worsening of behavioral symptoms with short-term tryptophan depletion, but none of the 17 patients showed any significant change in clinical status from baseline after sham depletion (P = .001). Tryptophan depletion led to a significant increase in behaviors such as whirling, flapping, pacing, banging and hitting self, rocking, and toe walking (P < .05). In addition, patients were significantly less calm and happy and more anxious. No significant change was observed in social relatedness or repetitive thoughts and behavior. Plasma total and free tryptophan levels were reduced 86% and 69%, respectively, 5 hours after the tryptophan-deficient amino acid drink. Patients who had a significant global exacerbation of symptoms had significantly higher baseline plasma total tryptophan levels (P < .001) and Autism Behavior Checklist scores (P = .005) than did patients who showed no significant change in symptoms after tryptophan depletion.
CONCLUSIONS The results of this study are consistent with previous research that has implicated a dysregulation in serotonin function in some patients with autism.

BACKGROUND Autistic disorder is characterized by a fundamental disturbance in social interaction, impairments in communication, and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests. Abnormalities in the serotonin neurotransmitter system have been identified in some persons with autism. No consistently effective and safe drugs have been developed for treating the symptoms of autism.
METHODS Thirty adults with autistic disorder completed a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitor fluvoxamine maleate. Behavioral ratings were obtained at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment.
RESULTS Eight (53%) of 15 patients in the fluvoxamine-treated group were categorized as responders compared with none of 15 in the placebo group (P = .001). Fluvoxamine was superior to placebo in reducing repetitive thoughts and behavior (P < .001), maladaptive behavior (P < .001), and aggression (P < .03), and in improving some aspects of social relatedness (P < .04), especially language usage (P < .008). Treatment response was not correlated with age level of autistic behavior, or full-scale IQ. Other than mild sedation and nausea in a few patients, fluvoxamine was well tolerated. No dyskinesias, adverse cardiovascular events, or seizures occurred.
CONCLUSIONS Fluvoxamine is more effective than placebo in the short-term treatment of the symptoms of autistic disorder in adults. Controlled studies of fluvoxamine and other potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitors seem warranted in children and adolescents with autism.

Serial electrocardiographic (ECG) changes are a critical component of the diagnostic algorithm for classification of myocardial ischemic events in large-scale clinical trials. This study describes a computerized serial ECG classification program developed at the St. Louis University Core ECG Laboratory for use in the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI) trial, in which patients with multivessel coronary artery disease were randomized to receive either coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The St. Louis University program detects and codes serial changes in Q, ST, and T wave items according to Minnesota code (MC) criteria using a modified NOVACODE hierarchical classification system. Measurements using a seven-power calibrated coding loupe are used to generate the MC from a customized software program. Significant minor or major changes are detected by the serial comparison program and referred to a physician coder for verification. Serial comparison coding rules are used to adjust for weaknesses in the standard MC classification system resulting from instability at decision boundaries. Of 4,244 BARI randomized and registry study participants with follow-up ECGs received at the Core ECG Laboratory as of March 1995, a grade 2 MC Q wave progression was noted in 568 participants (13.4%) using MC criteria alone, as compared with 367 (8.6%) after the St. Louis University coding rules were applied. The incidence of grade 1 MC Q wave progressions was 16.4% (697/4,244) versus 6.1% (259/4,244) when the St. Louis University program was applied. Intraobserver variability for grade 2 Q wave progression codes determined from a sample of 812 serial.

Experimental studies of prevention programs often randomize clusters of individuals rather than individuals to treatment conditions. When the correlation among individuals within clusters is not accounted for in statistical analysis, the standard errors are biased, potentially resulting in misleading conclusions about the significance of treatment effects. This study demonstrates the generalized estimating equations (GEE) method, focusing specifically on the GEE-independent method, to control for within-cluster correlation in regression models with either continuous or binary outcomes. The GEE-independent method yields consistent and robust variance estimates. Data from project DARE, a youth substance abuse prevention program, are used for illustration.

The practice of routinely prehydrating patients by infusing a crystalloid or colloid solution (up to 1.0 L/70 kg) for prevention of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension has been challenged recently, after several reports of failure to demonstrate its efficacy in young women. We compared the incidence and frequency of hypotension and vasopressor therapy after spinal anesthesia and no prehydration with crystalloid and colloid prehydration in elderly patients. Eighty-five ASA grade I or II patients (aged 60-89 yr) for elective total hip replacement were randomized to receive 500 mL crystalloid solution (Hartmanns, n = 29), 500 mL colloid (Haemaccel, n = 28), or no prehydration (n = 28) over 10 min prior to spinal anesthesia. Hypotension was defined as a 30% decrease from baseline systolic blood pressure (BP) or systolic < 90 mm Hg, and was treated with ephedrine 3-mg boluses. Although absolute systolic BP readings were significantly higher in the colloid group between 6 and 30 min (P < 0.05), the incidence of hypotension was not significantly different between the groups. The incidence of ephedrine use, incidence of nausea/vomiting, and median total dose of ephedrine were similar in all groups. We conclude that, in elderly patients undergoing elective procedures, withholding prehydration is not associated with any greater degree of hypotension or need for vasopressor therapy compared with crystalloid or colloid prehydration.

BACKGROUND Allergic conjunctivitis is one of the most frequent allergic diseases of the anterior eye segment.
METHODS This multicentre, clinical trial was an investigation to compare the antiallergic efficacy, local tolerance and safety of Antazolin/Tetryzolin eye drops and Levocabastine eye drops. 69 patients were treated over a 2 weeks course of therapy. The subjective and objective ocular symptoms were documented over the treatment period.
RESULTS Both eye drops reduced subjective and objective ocular symptoms effective. The difference between the treatments (p = 0.0395) was the faster onset of action of Antazolin/Tetryzolin 30 minutes after administration of the first drop of trial medication.
CONCLUSION A fast and effective onset of action is of high clinical relevance. Therefore the benefits of using Antazolin/Tetryzolin eye drops was clearly outweigh.

The results of experimental and clinical studies support the hypothesis that gut-derived endotoxins might be of relevance for the development and course of alcoholic liver disease. The aim of this study was to test the effect of a nonabsorbable, broad-spectrum antibiotic on endotoxemia in patients with alcoholic liver disease. Fifty patients with alcoholic liver disease (27 with cirrhosis, 23 without cirrhosis) were randomly assigned to receive either paromomycin sulfate (3 x 1 g/day) or placebo in a double-blind fashion for at least 3 weeks, and if possible 4 weeks. Endotoxin concentration, liver function tests, and other laboratory parameters were determined in weekly intervals. Endotoxin concentration was also determined in 15 healthy controls. Groups receiving paromomycin or placebo were similar for clinical and biological items collected initially. Mean initial endotoxin concentrations were significantly elevated in both groups (mean +/- SEM; paromomycin, 16.7 +/- 5.3 pg/ml; placebo, 17.5 +/- 6.9 pg/ml; healthy controls, 2.3 +/- 0.4 pg/ml). Although the mean endotoxin concentration was lower in the verum group after 1 week (paromomycin, 8.0 +/- 1.9 pg/ml; placebo, 14.6 +/- 3.5 pg/ml; p > 0.05), paromomycin treatment had no significant effect on endotoxin concentration or liver function tests during the 4-week period. The beneficial effect of paromomycin treatment on endotoxemia in cirrhotics reported in earlier studies could not be reproduced under the conditions of this trial in patients with alcoholic liver disease.

The pain-relieving effect of indomethacin phonophoresis on temporomandibular (TMJ) joint pain was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Twenty subjects, who have TMJ pain, were included for this study and randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n = 10) or the control group (n = 10). Each treatment consisted of the application of ultrasound massage (1.0 MHz, 0.8 to 1.5 W/cm2 continuous output) for 15 minutes to the painful temporomandibular joint. As a conducting medium, 1% indomethacin cream was used for the experimental group and placebo cream for the control group respectively. Pre- and post-treatment pain levels and pain sensitivity were assessed with visual analogue scales (VAS) and pressure pain threshold (PPT). Mean data indicated that post-treatment VAS was significantly decreased and post-treatment PPT was significantly increased in the experimental group, not in the control group. The results of this study suggest that indomethacin phonophoresis provides significant pain relieving effect over the TMJ pain.

BACKGROUND Human brain natriuretic peptide (hBNP) is a promising agent for the treatment of decompensated cardiac failure. However, the systemic hemodynamic, neurohormonal, and renal effects of hBNP have been incompletely studied in human heart failure.
METHODS AND RESULTS The effects of a continuous 4-hour infusion of hBNP were determined in 16 decompensated heart failure patients in an invasive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were evaluated during three 4-hour study periods: baseline, treatment (placebo [n = 4] versus hBNP 0.025 or 0.05 microgram/kg/min [n = 12]), and post-treatment. Urinary volume losses were replaced hourly to separate the vasodilatory and diuretic effects of hBNP. Two patients in the hBNP group were excluded from the analysis because of adverse events. hBNP significantly (P < .001) reduced right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively. hBNP also significantly lowered systemic vascular resistance from 1722 +/- 139 to 1101 +/- 83 dynes.s.cm-5 (P < .05). These unloading effects of hBNP produced a 28% increase in cardiac index (P < .05) with no change in heart rate. Compared to placebo, hBNP decreased plasma norepinephrine and aldosterone. Renal hemodynamics were unaffected by hBNP; however, most patients were resistant to its natriuretic effect.
CONCLUSIONS 1) The predominant hemodynamic effects of hBNP were a decrease in cardiac preload and systemic vascular resistance. 2) hBNP also improved cardiac output without increasing heart rate. 3) Plasma norepinephrine and aldosterone levels decreased during hBNP infusion. 4) hBNP is pharmacologically active and has potential in the therapy for decompensated heart failure.

BACKGROUND The role of bronchodilators in the treatment of bronchiolitis remains controversial.
METHODS A double-blind, placebo controlled trial was performed to evaluate the clinical response to nebulized salbutamol. One hundred and fifty-six infants aged between 7 weeks and 24 months who had had an episode of wheezing and other signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis were randomized to three groups as follows: (i) nebulized salbutamol was administered to 52 patients in group I at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg in 2 mL saline; (ii) saline was nebulized to 52 patients in group II and (iii) in group III 52 patients received mist in a tent. All three groups were administered oxygen during the procedures. Treatment was repeated with the same agent after 30 min if the respiratory score was 5 or more. Respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation and presence of cyanosis, wheezing, retractions were recorded before and after each treatment.
RESULTS The decrease in the respiratory score was 5.2 +/- 1.8, 0.82 +/- 2.4 and 1.7 +/- 1.3 in group I, II and III, respectively. The decrease in group I was significantly higher than in the other groups. Heart rate was similar between groups. Oxygen saturation decreased in group I without reaching statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS Salbutamol was shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis.

Although corticosteroid therapy might be clinically beneficial for bronchiectasis, very little is known of its effects on the inflammatory and infective markers in bronchiectasis. We have therefore performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of a 4-wk administration of inhaled fluticasone in bronchiectasis. Twenty-four patients (12 female; mean age 51 yr) were randomized into receiving either inhaled fluticasone (500 microgram twice daily) via the Accuhaler device (n = 12) or placebo. At each visit, spirometry, 24-h sputum volume, sputum leukocyte density, bacterial densities, and concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) were determined. There was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in sputum leukocyte density and IL-1beta, IL-8, and LTB4 after fluticasone treatment. The fluticasone group had one and the placebo group three episodes of exacerbation. There were no significant changes in spirometry (p > 0.05) or any reported adverse reactions in either group. The results of this study show that high-dose fluticasone is effective in reducing the sputum inflammatory indices in bronchiectasis. Large-scale and long-term studies are indicated to evaluate the effects of inhaled steroid therapy on the inflammatory components in bronchiectasis.

Amonafide is a new imide derivative of naphthalic acid. The drug had demonstrated significant activity in preclinical studies and some activity in Phase I trials. The drug is extensively metabolized and detected in plasma and urine. Its toxicity has previously been correlated to the formation of an active metabolite, N-acetyl-amonafide. Amonafide was chosen for inclusion in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) master metastatic breast cancer protocol. CALGB 8642 randomizes previously untreated metastatic breast cancer patients either to one of several Phase II agents given for up to four cycles and then followed by standard cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil, or to immediate treatment with standard cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil. The end point of CALGB 8642 is to assess the difference in survival, toxicity, and overall response when limited exposure to Phase II agents precedes standard chemotherapy. This report deals only with amonafide as a Phase II agent. Comparisons with the cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil arm will not be addressed. Patients had to have histologically documented measurable breast cancer and a performance status of 0-1. Patients could not have had prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy was permitted. Patients could not have visceral crisis. Amonafide was given at 300 mg/m2/day i.v. for 5 days, and repeated at 21-day intervals for a maximum of four cycles. Escalation and reduction in dose was mandated dependent on hematotoxicity or lack thereof. Toxicity was primarily hematological and bimodal: 32% had grade 3 or 4 leukopenia and 24% had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia; 22% had no leukopenia and 44% had no thrombocytopenia. The response rate was 18%, including one complete response. When response was analyzed by hematological toxicity, there was a 35.7% response if patients had leukopenia grade 3/4 (versus 8.3%, P = 0.08). There was a 50% response if patients had thrombocytopenia grade 3/4 (versus 7.1%, P = <0.01). We conclude that amonafide is somewhat active in previously untreated breast cancer patients. There may be a steep dose-response curve, based on the significant correlation between myelosuppression and response. Rates of responses in patients adequately dosed (i.e., with significant hematotoxicity) with amonafide ranged from 35 to 50%. Further studies will incorporate individualized dosing based on pretreatment acetylator phenotyping.
