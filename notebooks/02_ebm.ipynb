      "A randomized comparison of alternative techniques to achieve coronary sinus cannulation during biventricular implantation procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "INTRODUCTION Biventricular pacing system implantation is a time-consuming and challenging procedure. A critical step in biventricular pacemaker implantation is coronary sinus (CS) cannulation. CS cannulation can be achieved either using dedicated guiding catheters (guiding catheter alone positioning strategy, GCA) or with the aid of an electrophysiology catheter advanced inside the guiding catheter (electrophysiology catheter aided positioning strategy, EPA).\n",
      "AIM OF THE STUDY To evaluate whether the EPA technique is useful for reducing CS cannulation time compared to a conventional GCA technique.\n",
      "METHODS Thirty-four consecutive patients were randomly assigned to the GCA (18 patients) or EPA (16 patients) CS cannulation strategy.\n",
      "RESULTS Time to successful catheterization of CS was 5.0 +/- 2.4 min in the EPA group versus 10.1 +/- 5.4 min in the GCA group p = 0.004. Fluoroscopy time was 4.6 +/- 2.3 min in the EPA group versus 9.2 +/- 4.9 min in the GCA group p = 0.004. Total contrast dye volume to search and engage the CS ostium was 0.0 ml in the EPA group versus 14.3 +/- 3.4 ml in the GCA group p < 0.001.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS Cannulation of CS with the adjunct of an electrophysiology catheter to dedicated delivery systems significantly reduces procedural time, fluoroscopy time and contrast dye volume compared to a conventional strategy.\n",

      "PURPOSE To evaluate the effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) of switching from timolol to latanoprost or adding latanoprost to timolol in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension where IOP is not adequately controlled with timolol.\n",
      "METHODS This was a 6-week, double-masked, randomised multi-centre study. 53 patients with primary open angle glaucoma, capsular glaucoma, or ocular hypertension with an IOP of at least 21 mmHg on current therapy were recruited. After a run-in period of at least 2 weeks on timolol, 5 mg/ml twice daily, patients were randomised to one of three groups. One group continued on timolol, one switched from timolol to latanoprost, 50 microg/ml once daily, and a third group received latanoprost in addition to timolol. The efficacy was evaluated by comparing IOP at 9 AM at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment.\n",
      "RESULTS IOP at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment (mean +/- SEM) were 24.2 +/- 0.9 and 23.8 +/- 1.0 mmHg (n = 16) for patients continuing on timolol, 26.3 +/- 1.2 and 19.6 +/- 1.1 mmHg (n = 17) for patients switching to latanoprost, and 23.2 +/- 1.0 and 17.5 +/- 0.8 mmHg (n = 17) for patients with combined treatment. Adding latanoprost to timolol reduced IOP with 5.9 +/- 0.9 mmHg (p < 0.001) and switching from timolol to latanoprost reduced IOP with 5.0 +/- 0.9 mmHg (p < 0.001), which caused in each group a significant IOP reduction of about 25%.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS The effect of latanoprost was additive to that of timolol, and a good effect on IOP reduction was also achieved by switching from timolol to latanoprost, suggesting that a switch in many patients is an effective alternative to combination treatment.\n",

      "\n",
      "Women who smoke and take oral contraceptives (OCs) have significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but the exact mechanismsfor the increased risk are not known. Cardiovascular reactivity to psychological stress may be one mechanism for the enhanced risk, but the small number of studies examining whether OC users who smoke have greater reactivity have produced mixed results. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of chronic cigarette smoking, acute nicotine administration, and OC use on cardiovascular and lipid reactivity. Sixty healthy women, half of whom had been using OCs for at least the previous 6 months, participated in the study. Approximately two thirds were smokers and were randomized to be tested after either a 12-hr nicotine deprivation or administration of nicotine gum. One third were nonsmokers. Heart rate, blood pressure, and lipid measures were taken at rest, during a videotaped speech task, and during recovery from the task. Results indicated that, among OC nonusers, there was no effect of smoking status or nicotine administration on cardiovascular reactivity. However, among OC users, nonsmokers had significantly greater heart rate and diastolic blood pressure reactivity to stress. These data show that acute nicotine administration, in the form of nicotine gum, has no effect on cardiovascular or lipid stress reactivity in women. However OC use among nonsmoking women is associated with greater cardiovascular reactivity to stress.\n",

      "\n",
      "Parents of children who receive the diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) experience a situational crisis related to receiving the diagnosis, which causes feelings of distress and urgency to access services for the affected child. This paper describes a randomized trial (n = 31) that was conducted at a regional diagnostic center of a large metropolitan children's hospital to (a) refine a nursing intervention designed for parents of children with ASD and (b) to identify methodological revisions for a larger study. A secondary purpose was to test the effects of a post-diagnosis nursing intervention on parents' reports of stress, impact of event (diagnosis), and use of services after a child is newly diagnosed with ASD. The intervention consisted of usual care plus 3 hours contact with a pediatric nurse practitioner (PNP) for counseling, instruction, and assistance with implementation of the recommended treatment plan. The control group received only the usual care post-diagnosis, which consisted of a 1-hour consultation session to receive the results of diagnostic tests and a written copy of the recommended treatment plan provided by a developmental pediatrician and/or PNP. Between group differences in measures of \"impact of event\" and \"perceived stress\" were not statistically significant. This was attributed to a small sample size. A larger study is feasible and recommended with an expanded nursing intervention and a significantly larger sample recruited from an additional recruitment site. Nurses working with this special population must recognize that parents have information and counseling needs that begin after they receive the diagnosis of ASD for their child and can address these needs with a standardized nursing intervention.\n",

      "Eighty-three patients with small cell lung cancer were randomized with or without using a traditional Chinese Kidney-tonifying decoction (Liu Wei Di Huang or Jin Gui Shen Qi medicinal decoction) in chemotherapy or radiotherapy courses. 74 patients were availble to be analysis. The two treatment groups were well-matched in age, sex, stage and performance status. There was a statistically significant difference in response rate and the median survival between two groups. The overall response rate (CR+PR) was 91.5% for Chinese herb group and 46.9% for control group (P less than 0.001). The median survival was 16 months for the traditional Chinese Kidney-tonifying decoction group, and 10 months for the control group (P less than 0.05). Survival curve (Kaplan-meire's) of the Chinese herb group was better than that of the control group. 10 patients of Chinese herb group was alive beyond more than 2 years. Until now, 4 patients in the Chinese herb group, one in the control group are still enjoying their disease-free life for more than 7 years. Hematologic toxicities were observed much frequently in the patients of the control group (P less than 0.005 and 0.01/WBC and BPC). Results of animal experiments with the same traditional medicinal decoctions as used in clinic have showed immuno-enhancement activities. These results have showed that the traditional Chinese Kidney-tonifying decoction may enhance non-specific immunology activities and may be much useful for solid cancer patients as an adjuvant treatment.\n",

      "SUBJECTS AND METHODS Recruited 249 adults from Washington State aged 55 to 75 with a doctor-confirmed diagnosis of osteoarthritis to participate in aquatic classes. The Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB) and Current Health Desirability Rating (CHDR) were used for economic evaluation, supplemented by the arthritis-specific Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and Perceived Quality of Life Scale (PQOL) collected at baseline and postclass. Outcome results applied to life expectancy tables were used to estimate QALYs. Use of health care facilities was assessed from diaries/questionnaires and Medicare reimbursement rates used to estimate costs. Nonparametric bootstrap sampling of costs/QALY ratios established the 95% CI around the estimates.\n",
      "RESULTS Aquatic exercisers reported equal (QWB) or better (CHDR, HAQ, PQOL) health-related quality of life compared with controls. Outcomes improved with regular class attendance. Costs/QALY gained discounted at 3% were $205,186 using the QWB and $32,643 using the CHRD.\n",
      "CONCLUSION Aquatic exercise exceeded $50,000 per QALY gained using the community-weighted outcome but fell below this arbitrary budget constraint when using the participant-weighted measure. Confidence intervals around these ratios suggested wide variability of cost effectiveness of aquatic exercise.\n",

      "SUMMARY This study examined whether 24 months of weight training exercises enhanced the effectiveness of risedronate, calcium, and vitamin D in maintaining or improving bone mineral density (BMD) in 223 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Subjects who were > or =50% adherent to exercise had no improvement in BMD but were less likely to lose BMD.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION This study examined whether (1) postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (BCS) with bone loss taking 24 months of risedronate, calcium, and vitamin D had increased bone mineral density (BMD) at the total hip, femoral neck, L1-L4 spine, total radius and 33% radius, and decreased bone turnover; (2) subjects who also participated in strength/weight training (ST) exercises had greater increases in BMD and greater decreases in bone turnover; and (3) subjects who also exercised were more likely to preserve (at least maintain) BMD.\n",
      "METHODS Postmenopausal BCS (223) were randomly assigned to exercise plus medication or medication only groups. Both groups received 24 months of 1,200 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D daily and 35 mg of risedronate weekly, and the exercise group additionally had ST exercises twice weekly.\n",
      "RESULTS After 24 months, women who took medications without exercising had significant improvements in BMD at the total hip (+1.81%) and spine (+2.85%) and significant decreases in Alkphase B (-8.7%) and serum NTx (-16.7%). Women who also exercised had additional increases in BMD at the femoral neck (+0.29%), total hip (+0.34%), spine (+0.23%), total radius (+0.30%), and additional decreases in Alkphase B (-2.4%) and Serum NTx (-6.5%). Additional changes in BMD and bone turnover with exercise were not significant. Subjects who were > or =50% adherent to exercise were less likely to lose BMD at the total hip (chi-square [1] = 4.66, p = 0.03) and femoral neck (chi-square [1] = 4.63, p = 0.03).\n",

      "Feasibility of two dose-dense FEC regimens with growth factor support for adjuvant therapy in patients with early breast cancer: results from a randomised study of the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group (CECOG).\n",
      "\n",
      "Addition of epirubicin to adjuvant chemotherapy can provide important benefits for patients with early breast cancer, but the optimal dose remains unclear. Further improvements can be achieved with dose-dense regimens, but densification of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) has proved difficult, with FEC(60) providing little benefit over standard chemotherapy and FEC(100) associated with toxicity. We investigated the feasibility of two intermediate dose-dense FEC regimens. Patients were randomised to six cycles of FEC(75) or FEC(90), with all three drugs given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle. Patients also received pegfilgrastim 6 mg as a single subcutaneous injection on day 2 of each cycle. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects receiving > or =85% relative dose intensity and was achieved by 96% and 88% of patients in the FEC(75) and FEC(90) arms, respectively. Of 147 FEC(75) infusions, 4.1% were delayed, while 9.8% of 143 FEC(90) infusions were delayed. The most common reasons for delay were adverse events and personal/logistical reasons. One dose reduction occurred during the study (FEC(90)), related to diarrhoea. Grade 3-4 haematological toxicities were reported in two patients in the FEC(90) arm. There were no incidences of febrile neutropenia during the study. The most common adverse events were increases in liver enzymes and gastrointestinal events; no event resulted in discontinuation. Only one patient (FEC(90)) experienced serious adverse events (vomiting and throat oedema). In conclusion, dose-dense FEC(75 )and FEC(90) are feasible with pegfilgrastim support. These regimens are associated with a very low risk of Grade 3-4 toxicity.\n",

      "BACKGROUND We aimed to analyze clinical, microbiologic, and serologic effects of chlorhexidine (CHX) chips used as a subgingival controlled-release delivery device before and immediately after scaling and root planing (SRP).\n",
      "METHODS Twenty-four patients presenting with ≥12 teeth with probing depth (PD) ≥5 mm and bleeding on probing were assigned in test or control groups. After prophylaxis, CHX chips (test) or placebo chips (control) were placed in pockets with PD ≥5 mm. Ten days later, SRP was performed in all teeth with PD ≥4 mm in a single appointment. Immediately after SRP, new chips were inserted in all pockets with PD ≥5 mm. Parameters were assessed at baseline; beginning of SRP; and 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Subgingival samples were obtained at baseline; beginning of SRP; and at 1 month after treatment. Periodontal pathogens Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were analyzed. Serum levels of high sensitive C-reactive and lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins were measured. The changes of the parameters between and within the groups were tested by Mann-Whitney U test (P <0.05).\n",
      "RESULTS All clinical and serologic parameters improved in both groups over time. There was a significant difference in clinical attachment level (CAL) gain from baseline to 6 months between groups (1.17 mm in the test group versus 0.79 mm in the placebo group) (P <0.05). The treatment with CHX chips showed a greater reduction of the microorganisms of the \"red complex\" after 1 month (P = 0.02).\n",

      "\n",
      "The effects of the high intake of Maillard reaction products (MRP) on calcium availability in adolescents and across Caco-2 cell monolayers were examined. In a 2 week randomized two-period crossover trial, 18 male adolescents consumed two diets, named white diet (WD) and brown diet (BD), which were poor and rich in MRP, respectively. A 3 day balance was performed at the end of each period, and fasting blood samples were collected. Calcium solubility and absorption across Caco-2 cells were studied after the in vitro digestion of the diets. The in vitro assay showed similar solubility after the in vitro digestion and similar transport across Caco-2 cells. In accordance, calcium bioavailability in adolescents did not vary between the diets (%WD = 40.4 +/- 5.1, %BD = 38.2 +/- 3.6). Serum and urine biochemical parameters related to calcium status and bone metabolism remained unaltered. Only deoxypyridinoline values were significantly lower after consumption of the BD (13.0 +/- 1.1 compared to 18.3 +/- 2.1 nM/Mm Cr in the WD), possibly indicative of less efficient bone turnover during this period. As calcium acquired during adolescence is essential to maximize peak bone mass and to prevent osteoporosis, possible long-term effects of excessive MRP intake during this period warrant attention.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE To study the clinical efficacy of the laparoscopic surgery in combination of Quyu Jiedu Recipe (QYJDR) on endometriosis (EMs)-related infertility patients.\n",
      "METHODS 130 EMs-related infertility patients of blood stasis and toxin accumulation syndrome diagnosed and treated by laparoscopic surgery were randomly assigned to two groups, i.e., the test group (75 cases) and the control group (55 cases). All patients received routine progesterone treatment after laparoscopic surgery. QYJDR was given to patients in the test group after laparoscopic surgery, lasting for twelve months. The pregnancy rate within one year after laparoscopic surgery were compared between the two groups. The Chinese medicine syndrome integrals, serum endometrium antibody (EMAb) and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) levels were compared between before drug therapy and three months after drug therapy.\n",
      "RESULTS The pregnancy rate within one year after laparoscopic surgery was higher in the test group than in the control group [61.33% (46/75) vs 45.45% (25/55)], showing significant difference (P<0.05). The Chinese medicine syndrome integral was (16.07 +/- 6.77) score and (7.25 +/- 3.27) score before and 3 months after drug therapy in the test group, while it was (15.92 +/- 7.51) score and (12.73 +/- 6.12) score in the control group. The Chinese medicine syndrome integral after drug therapy was lower than that before drug therapy in the same group. Besides, the integral difference between before and after drug therapy was higher in the test group than in the control group [(9.12 +/- 6.16) score vs (3.48 +/- 2.06) score)], showing statistical difference (P<0.05). After three-month drug therapy, the serum EMAb negative conversion rate was obviously higher in the test group than in the control group (44.44% vs 15.62%), showing statistical difference (P<0.05). The serum CA125 level was (31.88 +/- 15.78) U/mL before drug therapy and (18.82 +/- 10.08) U/mL three months after drug therapy in the test group, while it was (30.63 +/- 19.28) U/mL and (18.05 +/- 11.20) U/mL respectively in the control group. It was lowered after drug therapy in the two groups with statistical difference (P<0.05). There was no statistical difference between the two groups after drug therapy (P>0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic surgery in combination of QYJDR could effectively improve clinical symptoms of EMs patients of blood stasis and toxin accumulation syndrome, promote negative conversion of EMAb, lower serum CA125 levels, and elevate the clinical pregnancy rate. QYJDR is an effective formula in treatment of EMs-related infertility.\n",

      "\n",
      "PURPOSE Internal stenting is an integral part of endopyelotomy. Studies in animals show good healing after 1 to 2 weeks of ureterotomy. Inherent stent related problems warrant a minimum possible duration of stenting without compromising the results of endopyelotomy. We performed a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the optimum duration of stenting after endopyelotomy.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 57 consecutive patients with primary ureteropelvic junction obstruction were randomized to undergo 7/14Fr internal endopyelotomy stent placement for 2 (group 1) and 4 (group 2) weeks. A symptom based questionnaire was administered to all patients at stent removal. Followup was done with diuretic scanning at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and then yearly, and thereafter with diuretic renography.\n",
      "RESULTS In each group 26 patients were available for evaluation. The 2 groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, symptoms and ipsilateral glomerular filtration rate. Mean followup was 22.3 (range 12 to 36) and 21.3 months (range 12 to 35) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. At the end of 1 year 24 group 1 (92.3%) and 23 group 2 (90.3%) patients had an improved drainage pattern. This difference was not significant. Stent related symptoms were present in a good proportion of patients in groups 1 and 2 but there was a significant difference in the incidence of urinary tract infections (11.5% versus 38.1%, p = 0.04). Of the group 2 patients 64% preferred 2 weeks of stenting.\n",

      "\n",
      "The vaccine Zostavax has been shown to prevent herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia and is recommended for individuals > or =60 years of age. This study compared the safety and the immunogenicity of a refrigerator-stable formulation (Zostavax refrigerated) with those of the current formulation (Zostavax frozen) in subjects > or =50 years of age. Subjects with a negative history for HZ were randomized 1:1 to receive one dose of either formulation. Enrollment was stratified 1:2 by age (50 to 59 years and > or =60 years). Safety was evaluated for 28 days postvaccination. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody responses were measured by a glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA). The primary endpoints were the VZV antibody geometric mean titer (GMT; day 28), the VZV antibody geometric mean rise (GMR; days 1 to 28), and the incidence of vaccine-related serious adverse experiences (AEs) over 28 days. The refrigerated (n = 182) and frozen (n = 185) formulations induced similar GMTs (727.4 and 834.4 gpELISA units/ml, respectively); the estimated GMT ratio (refrigerated formulation/frozen formulation) was 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.71 to 1.07). The GMRs were 2.6- and 2.9-fold, respectively. No vaccine-related serious AEs were reported in either group, and the safety profiles of the formulations were generally similar. The frequencies of injection-site AEs during follow-up were 35.6% and 46.4% in the refrigerated and the frozen formulation groups, respectively, and were generally mild. The frequencies of systemic AEs were similar in the two groups, and those of vaccine-related AEs were approximately 6% in both groups. The refrigerator-stable formulation of Zostavax has an acceptable safety profile and is as immunogenic as the frozen formulation; thus, the vaccine may be used in clinical settings where freezer availability is limited.\n",

      "Recent studies have suggested that children with autism perform better than matched controls on visual search tasks and that this stems from a superior visual discrimination ability. This study assessed whether these findings generalize from children to adults with autism. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that, like children, adults with autism were superior to controls at searching for targets. Experiment 3 showed that increases in target-distractor similarity slowed the visual search performance of the control group significantly more than that of the autism group, suggesting that the adults with autism have a superior visual discrimination ability. Thus, these experiments replicate in adults previous findings in children with autism. Superior unique item detection in adults with autism, stemming from enhanced discrimination, is discussed in the light of the possible role of stimulus processing disturbances in the disorder in general.\n",

Combined information improved behavioral intentions across grades; however, girls (vs. boys) were more responsive to information as evidenced by differences in academic intentions. The combination of descriptive and explanatory information about autism appears to have a positive effect on children's attitudes and behavioral intentions.

      "\n",
      "BACKGROUND Breast cancer surgery performed with the patient under general anesthesia has been associated with a relatively high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Between 60% and 80% of patients who undergo mastectomy (with axillary dissection) experience PONV. We previously reported that propofol at a subhypnotic dose of 0.5 mg/kg was more effective than placebo in preventing PONV in women who undergo mastectomy.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of a subhypnotic dose of propofol with the conventional antiemetics droperidol and metoclopramide for the prophylaxis of PONV after breast cancer surgery in Japanese patients.\n",
      "METHODS In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Japanese women were randomized to 1 of 4 groups to receive IV administration of propofol 0.5 mg/kg, droperidol 20 microg/kg, metoclopramide 0.2 mg/kg, or placebo (isotonic saline) immediately after skin suture. A standard general anesthetic technique, including sevoflurane and air in oxygen, was used. All episodes of PONV during the first 24 hours after anesthesia administration were recorded by an investigator who was blinded to treatment assignment. The investigator questioned the patients as to whether they experienced extrapyramidal symptoms. To maintain the integrity of the study results, none of the patients received preanesthetic medication.\n",
      "RESULTS A total of 100 women (mean [SD] age, 52 [7] years; height, 154 [6] cm; weight, 54 [7] kg) were included in the study. Each study group comprised 25 patients. There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to patient demographics, surgery type, or awakening time. The prevalences of PONV 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia were 28% with propofol (P = 0.005), 32% with droperidol (P = 0.011), and 60% with metoclopramide (P = NS), compared with placebo (68%). No significant difference in the prevalence of PONV was found between patients receiving propofol and those receiving droperidol, and propofol and droperidol were associated with significantly lower prevalences of PONV compared with metoclopramide (P = 0.022 and P = 0.043, respectively). Extrapyramidal symptoms were not reported in any of the groups.\n",

      "\n",
      "INTRODUCTION The question of whether abstinence during the months following a planned quit attempt exacerbates or improves depressive symptoms is an important clinical issue. Extant research has primarily modeled between-person covariation between postquit abstinence and depressive symptom trajectories. However, this approach cannot account for potential third variables between participants that may affect both smoking and depression. Accordingly, the current study examined within-person covariation between time-varying abstinence and depressive symptom in a multilevel model (MLM), which allowed for transitions between smoking statuses within a participant.\n",
      "METHODS Participants were 236 heavy drinking smokers in a randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of incorporating brief alcohol intervention into smoking cessation treatment. Depressive symptoms and biochemically verified abstinence were assessed 1 week prior to and 2, 8, 16, and 26 weeks after quit date.\n",
      "RESULTS MLMs indicated a slight increase in depressive symptoms over time in the sample as a whole. However, there was an inverse relation between time-varying abstinence (vs. smoking) and concurrent level of depressive symptoms, indicating that transitions from smoking to abstinence within individuals were associated with reductions in depressive symptoms.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS During the first 6 months following a planned quit attempt, being abstinent in a particular week appears to be associated with lower levels of concurrent depressive symptoms. These results are not concordant with the view that intentional smoking abstinence exacerbates depressive symptoms. Efforts to promote smoking cessation should highlight that individuals are likely to feel more rather than less psychologically healthy when they successfully quit smoking.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION Time in therapeutic range (TTR) for international normalized ratio (INR) is an accepted quality measure of anticoagulation control in patient populations, but its usefulness for predicting stroke and bleeding in individuals is not well understood.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS In a nested case control analysis among ACTIVE W study patients, cases with stroke and cases with bleeding were separately matched with controls. Several anticoagulation quality measures were compared, overall and in a time-dependent manner.\n",
      "RESULTS 32 cases with ischemic stroke and 234 cases with bleeding in the analysis were matched in a 4:1 ratio to 122 and 865 controls, respectively. Follow-up duration was 257±154days for the stroke analysis and 222±146days for the bleeding analysis. Compared with their respective controls, the study mean TTR of both stroke cases (53.9%±25.1 vs 63.4%±24.8; p=0.055) and bleeding cases (56.2%±25.4 vs 63.4%±26.8; p<0.001) was lower. Time below range for stroke and time above range for bleeding were only greater in the last month leading up to the event, not over the entire study period. Rather, over the entire study period bleeding cases spent more time below range than controls (26.8%±25.9 vs 20.8%±24.0; p=0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS TTR was lower in individual AF patients with stroke or bleeding compared with matched controls in ACTIVE W. Maintaining a high TTR, with equal importance to avoid low and high INRs, is a relevant goal of individual patient treatment to prevent stroke and bleeding.\n",

      "This paper presents the rationale for a 24-week, randomized trial designed to test whether risperidone plus structured parent training would be superior to risperidone only on measures of noncompliance, irritability and adaptive functioning. In this model, medication reduces tantrums, aggression and self-injury; parent training promotes improvement in noncompliance and adaptive functioning. Thus, medication and parent training target related, but separate, outcomes. At week 24, the medication was gradually withdrawn to determine whether subjects in the combined treatment group could be managed on a lower dose or off medication without relapse. Both symptom reduction and functional improvement are important clinical treatment targets. Thus, experimental evidence on the beneficial effects of combining pharmacotherapy and exportable behavioral interventions is needed to guide clinical practice.\n",

      "\n",
      "Vibrotactile stimuli can elicit compelling auditory sensations, even when sound energy levels are minimal and undetectable. It has previously been shown that subjects judge auditory tones embedded in white noise to be louder when they are accompanied by a vibrotactile stimulus of the same frequency. A first experiment replicated this result at four different levels of auditory stimulation (no tone, tone at detection threshold, tone at 5 dB above threshold, and tone at 10 dB above threshold). The presence of a vibrotactile stimulus induced an increase in the perceived loudness of auditory tones at three of the four values in this range. In two further experiments, a 2-interval forced-choice procedure was used to assess the nature of this cross-modal interaction. Subjects were biased when vibrotaction was applied in one interval, but applying vibrotaction in both intervals produced performance comparable to conditions without vibrotactile stimuli. This demonstrates that vibrotaction is sometimes ignored when judging the presence of an auditory tone. Hence the interaction between vibrotaction and audition does not appear to occur at an early perceptual level.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE Forceps biopsy is the standard method to obtain specimens in endoscopically visible lesions. It is common to combine forceps biopsy with cytology methods to increase the diagnostic yield. Although the flexible cryoprobe has been established for bronchoscopic interventions in malignant stenosis, the obtained biopsies, called \"cryobiopsies,\" have not been investigated in a large cohort of patients. The aim of this feasibility study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic yield and safety of cryobiopsy and forceps biopsy.\n",
      "METHODS During a 6-year period, 296 patients with visible endoluminal tumor lesions were included in the study at the bronchoscopy unit of a university hospital. In the first consecutively conducted 55 cases, both techniques, forceps biopsy and cryobiopsy, were applied simultaneously. Pathologic and quantitative image analyses were performed to evaluate the size and quality of the obtained specimens. We evaluated the safety and diagnostic yield to describe the feasibility of cryobiopsy.\n",
      "RESULTS Comparative analysis of the first conducted and randomly assigned 55 cases revealed a significantly higher diagnostic yield for cryobiopsy compared with forceps biopsy (89.1% vs 65.5%, P < .05). In this cohort, quantitative image analysis showed significantly larger biopsies regarding size and artifact-free tissue sections for cryobiopsy compared with forceps biopsy (P < .0001). The overall diagnostic yield of cryobiopsy was 89.5%. Mild bleeding occurred in 11 cases (3.7%), moderate bleeding occurred in 3 cases (1.0%), and severe bleeding occurred in 1 case (0.3%).\n",

      "BACKGROUND A large body of evidence suggests that fine particulate matter (PM) air pollution is a cause of cardiovascular disease, but little is known in particular about the cardiovascular effects of indoor air pollution from household use of solid fuels in developing countries. RESPIRE (Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects) was a randomized trial of a chimney woodstove that reduces wood smoke exposure.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES We tested the hypotheses that the stove intervention, compared with open fire use, would reduce ST-segment depression and increase heart rate variability (HRV).\n",
      "METHODS We used two complementary study designs: a) between-groups comparisons based on randomized stove assignment, and b) before-and-after comparisons within control subjects who used open fires during the trial and received chimney stoves after the trial. Electrocardiogram sessions that lasted 20 hr were repeated up to three times among 49 intervention and 70 control women 38-84 years of age, and 55 control subjects were also assessed after receiving stoves. HRV and ST-segment values were assessed for each 30-min period. ST-segment depression was defined as an average value below -1.00 mm. Personal fine PM [aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM₂.₅] exposures were measured for 24 hr before each electrocardiogram.\n",
      "RESULTS PM₂.₅ exposure means were 266 and 102 μg/m³ during the trial period in the control and intervention groups, respectively. During the trial, the stove intervention was associated with an odds ratio of 0.26 (95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.90) for ST-segment depression. We found similar associations with the before-and-after comparison. The intervention was not significantly associated with HRV.\n",

      "BACKGROUND We sought to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of transcatheter intramyocardial administration of myoblasts in patients with heart failure (HF).\n",
      "METHODS MARVEL is a randomized placebo-controlled trial of image-guided, catheter-based intramyocardial injection of placebo or myoblasts (400 or 800 million) in patients with class II to IV HF and ejection fraction <35%. Primary end points were frequency of serious adverse events (safety) and changes in 6-minute walk test and Minnesota Living With HF score (efficacy). Of 330 patients intended for enrollment, 23 were randomized (MARVEL-1) before stopping the study for financial reasons.\n",
      "RESULTS At 6 months, similar numbers of events occurred in each group: 8 (placebo), 7 (low dose), and 8 (high dose), without deaths. Ventricular tachycardia responsive to amiodarone was more frequent in myoblast-treated patients: 1 (placebo), 3 (low dose), and 4 (high dose). A trend toward improvement in functional capacity was noted in myoblast-treated groups (Δ6-minute walk test of -3.6 vs +95.6 vs +85.5 m [placebo vs low dose vs high dose; P = .50]) without significant changes in Minnesota Living With HF scores.\n",

      "METHODS A randomised trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken in an EECU. The sample comprised 186 patients (mean age 70 years, 123 (66%) female patients, 130 (70%) trauma) who were referred for physiotherapy assessment/intervention. Referral occurred at any stage of the patients' EECU admission. All participants received medical/nursing care as required.

      "\n",
      "This study reports results of a randomized controlled trial aimed at joint attention (JA) and symbolic play (SP) in preschool children with autism, with prediction to language outcome 12 months later. Participants were 58 children (46 boys) with autism between 3 and 4 years of age. Children were randomized to a JA intervention, an SP intervention, or control group. Interventions were conducted 30 min daily for 5-6 weeks. Assessments of JA skills, SP skills, mother-child interactions, and language development were collected at 4 time points: pre- and postintervention and 6 and 12 months postintervention by independent testers. Results indicate that expressive language gains were greater for both treatment groups compared with the control group, and results could not be explained by differences in other interventions in which children participated. For children beginning treatment with the lowest language levels, the JA intervention improved language outcome significantly more than did the SP or control interventions. These findings suggest clinically significant benefits of actively treating JA and SP skills in young children with autism.\n",

      "BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in association with myoelectrical dysrhythmia, where different types of gastric electrical activity have been described. These types of gastric myoelectrical activity and dysrhythmia can be measured by electrogastrography using cutaneous electrodes. Epigastric impedance is a non-invasive method used to study gastric emptying time and gastric phasic activity. At present no study of gastric dysrhythmia, measured with epigastric impedance, has been presented, and the purpose of the present study was to investigate gastric rhythms by means of impedance gastrography in control infants, compared to infants with different gastrointestinal diseases, before and after treatment of their disease.\n",
      "METHOD 21 patients (age 0-2 months) and 40 healthy infants (age 0-2 months) were investigated. The patients suffered from partial or total intestinal obstruction, necrotizing enterocolitis or pyloric stenosis.All infants were fasting and studied during periods of at least one hour. The patients were examined in the acute state and after treatment when possible.\n",
      "RESULTS A pathologic result was found in 90% of the patients. A persistent phasic activity pattern was found in 19 of the 21 patients, high frequency phasic activity in 11 of the 21 patients. Short-term phasic activity was only found in 13 out of 40 of the normal infants (32.5%).\n",
      "CONCLUSION Using epigastric impedance we found that infants with partial or total intestinal obstruction had gastric phasic activity, which was not found in the control infants. The origin of the gastric phasic activity patterns is unknown, but they may be related to electrical control activity.\n",

      "BACKGROUND Few studies have compared treatment strategies in patients with asthma poorly controlled on low dose inhaled corticosteroids, and little is known about the effects of different treatments on airway inflammation. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, we compared the effects of salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate (FP) (Seretide; SFC) and FP plus montelukast (FP/M) on sputum inflammatory markers, airway responsiveness, lung function, and symptoms in adult asthmatics.\n",
      "METHODS Sixty-six subjects were randomised to SFC or FP/M for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was changes in neutrophil, eosinophil, macrophage, lymphocyte, and epithelial cell levels in induced sputum. Additional outcomes included the change in other sputum markers of airway inflammation, airway responsiveness, symptom control, and lung function.\n",
      "RESULTS Both treatments had no significant effect on induced sputum inflammatory cells, although there was a trend for a reduction in sputum eosinophils. Both treatments significantly improved airway responsiveness, whereas SFC generally led to greater improvements in symptom control and lung function than FP/M. FP/M led to significantly greater reductions in sputum cysteinyl leukotrienes than SFC (treatment ratio 1.80; 95% CI 1.09, 2.94).\n",

      "METHODS In this prospective study, we followed up 3790 heterosexual HIV-1-serodiscordant couples participating in two longitudinal studies of HIV-1 incidence in seven African countries. Among injectable and oral hormonal contraceptive users and non-users, we compared rates of HIV-1 acquisition by women and HIV-1 transmission from women to men. The primary outcome measure was HIV-1 seroconversion. We used Cox proportional hazards regression and marginal structural modelling to assess the effect of contraceptive use on HIV-1 risk.\n",
      "FINDINGS Among 1314 couples in which the HIV-1-seronegative partner was female (median follow-up 18·0 [IQR 12·6-24·2] months), rates of HIV-1 acquisition were 6·61 per 100 person-years in women who used hormonal contraception and 3·78 per 100 person-years in those who did not (adjusted hazard ratio 1·98, 95% CI 1·06-3·68, p=0·03). Among 2476 couples in which the HIV-1-seronegative partner was male (median follow-up 18·7 [IQR 12·8-24·2] months), rates of HIV-1 transmission from women to men were 2·61 per 100 person-years in couples in which women used hormonal contraception and 1·51 per 100 person-years in couples in which women did not use hormonal contraception (adjusted hazard ratio 1·97, 95% CI 1·12-3·45, p=0·02).

      "Distinct fast and slow processes contribute to the selection of preferred step frequency during human walking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Humans spontaneously select a step frequency that minimizes the energy expenditure of walking. This selection might be embedded within the neural circuits that generate gait so that the optimum is pre-programmed for a given walking speed. Or perhaps step frequency is directly optimized, based on sensed feedback of energy expenditure. Direct optimization is expected to be slow due to the compounded effect of delays and iteration, whereas a pre-programmed mechanism presumably allows for faster step frequency selection, albeit dependent on prior experience. To test for both pre-programmed selection and direct optimization, we applied perturbations to treadmill walking to elicit transient changes in step frequency. We found that human step frequency adjustments (n = 7) occurred with two components, the first dominating the response (66 ± 10% of total amplitude change; mean ± SD) and occurring quite quickly (1.44 ± 1.14 s to complete 95% of total change). The other component was of smaller amplitude (35 ± 10% of total change) and took tens of seconds (27.56 ± 16.18 s for 95% completion). The fast process appeared to be too fast for direct optimization and more indicative of a pre-programmed response. It also persisted even with unusual closed-loop perturbations that conflicted with prior experience and rendered the response energetically suboptimal. The slow process was more consistent with the timing expected for direct optimization. Our interpretation of these results is that humans may rely heavily on pre-programmed gaits to rapidly select their preferred step frequency and then gradually fine-tune that selection with direct optimization.\n",

      "BACKGROUND Eltrombopag is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist for the treatment of thrombocytopenia. We aimed to compare the response to once daily eltrombopag versus placebo in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia during a 6-month period.\n",
      "METHODS We undertook a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adults with previously treated immune thrombocytopenia of more than 6 months' duration who had baseline platelet counts lower than 30,000 per μL. Patients were randomly allocated (in a 2:1 ratio) treatment with local standard of care plus 50 mg eltrombopag or matching placebo once daily for 6 months. Randomisation was done centrally with a computer-generated randomisation schedule and was stratified by baseline platelet count (≤ 15,000 per μL), use of treatment for immune thrombocytopenia, and splenectomy status. Patients, investigators, and those assessing data were masked to allocation. Dose modifications were made on the basis of platelet response. Patients were assessed for response to treatment (defined as a platelet count of 50,000-400,000 per μL) weekly during the first 6 weeks and at least once every 4 weeks thereafter; the primary endpoint was the odds of response to eltrombopag versus placebo. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00370331.\n",
      "FINDINGS Between Nov 22, 2006, and July 31, 2007, 197 patients were randomly allocated to treatment groups and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (135 eltrombopag, 62 placebo). 106 (79%) patients in the eltrombopag group responded to treatment at least once during the study, compared with 17 (28%) patients in the placebo group. The odds of responding were greater in patients in the eltrombopag group compared with those in the placebo group throughout the 6-month treatment period (odds ratio 8·2, 99% CI 3·59-18·73; p<0·0001). 37 (59%) patients receiving eltrombopag reduced concomitant treatment versus ten (32%) patients receiving placebo (p=0·016). 24 (18%) patients receiving eltrombopag needed rescue treatment compared with 25 (40%) patients receiving placebo (p=0·001). Three (2%) patients receiving eltrombopag had thromboembolic events compared with none in patients on placebo. Nine (7%) eltrombopag-treated patients and two (3%) in the placebo group had mild increases in alanine aminotransferase concentration, and five (4%) eltrombopag-treated patients (vs none allocated to placebo) had increases in total bilirubin. Four (7%) patients taking placebo had serious bleeding events, compared with one (<1%) patient treated with eltrombopag.\n",
      "INTERPRETATION Eltrombopag is effective for management of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, and could be particularly beneficial for patients who have not responded to splenectomy or previous treatment.

      "BACKGROUND This study tested the hypothesis that, for colonoscopy, analgesia/sedation with remifentanil and propofol might be more effective compared with anesthesia by intravenous administration of midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol.\n",
      "METHODS In a prospective, randomized trial, 100 adult patients received either conscious analgesia/sedation (Sedation group) or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA group). Analgesia/sedation was achieved by infusion of remifentanil (0.20 to 0.25 microg/kg/min) and propofol in titrated doses. TIVA was induced by intravenous administration of fentanyl (2 microg/kg), midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) and propofol (dosage titrated). Cardiorespiratory parameters and bispectral index were monitored and recorded. The quality of the analgesia was assessed with a Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NRS); recovery level and return of psychomotor efficiency were evaluated with, respectively, the Aldrete scale and a Modified Post Anesthesia Discharge Scoring (MPADS) system.\n",
      "RESULTS Both groups of 50 patients were comparable with respect to demographic data, initial parameters, and duration of colonoscopy. All patients in the TIVA group found the colonoscopy painless (NRS score 0). In the Sedation group, the average pain intensity score was 0.4 (0.8). There was a marked difference between the Sedation and TIVA groups with respect to the time from the end of the procedure until the maximum MPADS score was reached: respectively, -6.9 (4.0) versus 25.7 (8.4) minutes (p < 0.001). In the TIVA group, changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate and signs of respiratory depression were significant (p < 0.05).\n",

In Groups IT0.1, C and IV, the NK cell activities showed no significant changes. In all four groups, neither plasma adrenaline nor noradrenaline concentrations changed. In all four groups, the plasma cortisol levels increased after surgery, on postoperative days 1 and 2. The pain score was lower two hours after surgery and on postoperative day 1 in Group IT0.5 than in the other groups.\n",

      "MATERIALS AND METHODS We used 100 ml of iopamidol 300 at an injection rate of 3.0 ml/s, 100 ml of iopamidol 300 at an injection rate of 3.7 ml/s, and 80 ml of iopamidol 370 at an injection rate of 3.0 ml/s. There were 10 patients in each group. Attenuation values of the bilateral internal carotid arteries (ICAs), basilar artery trunk, bilateral cavernous sinuses (CSs), and Galenic vein were measured quantitatively on the axial CT angiographic source images obtained by four-channel MDCT.\n",
      "RESULTS Injection of the high-concentration contrast with a higher iodine-delivery rate achieved good arteriovenous contrast at the cavernous portion. With the same rate of iodine delivery, injection of the intermediate concentrate agent increased the CT value of not only the ICAs but also the CSs.\n",

During the swing and stance phases, the kinesthetic locomotor imagery training exhibited significantly increased activation in a greater number of muscles and increased angular displacement of the knee and ankle joints compared with the visual locomotor imagery training, and these effects were more prominent when auditory step rhythm was integrated into each form of locomotor imagery training. The activation of the hamstring during the swing phase and the gastrocnemius during the stance phase, as well as kinematic data of the knee joint, were significantly different for posttest values between the visual locomotor imagery training and the kinesthetic locomotor imagery training with auditory step rhythm (P < 0.05).\n",

In a double-blind study, 24 CAPD patients with LVH [left ventricular mass index (LVMi) > 110 g/m2 for women and LVMi > 137 g/m2 for men] were randomized to 12 months' administration of either the ARB valsartan (n = 14) or a placebo (n = 10).

The following parameters were measured before and at the end of the study: aortic and large-artery compliance and arterial wave reflections [pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AI) application tonometry] and cardiac echocardiography. Periodically recorded were body weight, BP (mercury sphygmomanometer), serum creatinine, electrolytes, complete blood cell counts, urine volume, drainage volume, and weekly creatinine clearance. Two-way analysis of variance for repeated measurements was used for statistical analysis. Systolic and diastolic BP were both reduced in patients treated with ARB. The LVMi was significantly reduced in patients treated with ARB (to 121 +/- 4 from 145 +/- 5) but not in those receiving placebo (to 137 +/- 3 from 152 +/- 3, p < 0.05). The decrease in LVMi was associated with a reduction in PWV and AI. In CAPD patients with LVH, ARB reduced LVMi in association with alterations in arterial hemodynamics.\n",

This study assessed the effects of chronic treatment with low doses of aspirin (100 mg/day) on clinic and ambulatory systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP in hypertensives on chronic, stable antihypertensive therapy. The study was conducted in the framework of the Primary Prevention Project (PPP), a randomized, controlled factorial trial on the preventive effect of aspirin or vitamin E in people with one or more cardiovascular risk factors. Fifteen Italian hypertension units studied 142 hypertensive patients (76 men, 66 women; mean age 59 +/- 5.9 years) treated with different antihypertensive drugs: 71 patients were randomized to aspirin and 71 served as controls. All patients underwent a clinic BP evaluation with an automatic sphygmomanometer and a 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, at baseline and after 3 months of aspirin treatment. At the end of the study the changes in clinic SBP and DBP were not statistically different in treated and untreated subjects. Ambulatory SBP and DBP after 3 months of aspirin treatment were similar to baseline: deltaSBP -0.5 mmHg (95% confidence intervals [CI] from -1.9 to +2.9 mm Hg) and deltaDBP -1.1 mm Hg (95% CI from -2.5 to +0.3 mm Hg). The pattern was similar in the control group. No interaction was found between aspirin and the most used antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists). Despite the relatively small sample size our results seem to exclude any significant influence of low-dose aspirin on BP control in hypertensives under treatment.\n",

      "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the immediate clinical and microbiological efficacy of doxycycline (100 mg for 14 days) was carried out to determine the benefit of adjunctive medication in 16 patients with localized juvenile periodontitis. Measurements of gingival fluid flow, probing depths, bleeding on probing and suppuration were determined at 2 periodontal sites with and 2 without radiographic attachment loss, at weeks 0, 1, 3 and 8. Subgingival bacterial samples were taken with curettes from the same sites. Spirochaetes were searched for by dark-field microscopy. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, pigmented and non-pigmented Bacteroides spp., Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium and Actinomyces spp. were cultured on various selective and non-selective media. Bacterial species found at least in 50% of the patients and comprising on average 5% or more of the cultivable flora were included in the analysis. Neither short-term clinical nor microbiological efficacy beyond that of a course of mechanical debridement alone was found by using systemic medication with doxycycline in patients with localized juvenile periodontitis.\n",

      "\n",
      "BACKGROUND In the interest of preserving residual insulin secretory capacity present at the time of diagnosis with type 1 diabetes (T1D), we compared the efficacy of starting insulin pump therapy at diagnosis with standard multiple daily insulin injections (MDIs).\n",
      "METHODS We conducted a prospective, randomized, pilot trial comparing MDI therapy with continuous subcutaneous insulin therapy (pump therapy) in 24 patients, 8-18 years old, with newly diagnosed T1D. Subjects were evaluated at enrollment and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after initial diagnosis of T1D. Preservation of insulin secretion, measured by mixed-meal-stimulated C-peptide secretion, was compared after 6 and 12 months of treatment. Between-group differences in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), continuous glucose sensor data, insulin utilization, anthropometric measures, and patient satisfaction with therapy were also compared at multiple time points.\n",
      "RESULTS Initiation of pump therapy within 1 month of diagnosis resulted in consistently higher mixed-meal tolerance test-stimulated C-peptide values at all time points, although these differences were not statistically significant. Nonetheless, improved glycemic control was observed in insulin pump-treated subjects (more time spent with normoglycemia, better mean HbA1c), and pump-treated subjects reported comparatively greater satisfaction with route of treatment administration.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS Initiation of insulin pump therapy at diagnosis improved glycemic control, was well tolerated, and contributed to improved patient satisfaction with treatment. This study also suggests that earlier use of pump therapy might help to preserve residual β-cell function, although a larger clinical trial would be required to confirm this.\n",

      "To verify the efficacy and the tolerability of local immunotherapy (LI) by inhalation of a powder extract of house dust mite (HDM), in comparison with parenteral immunotherapy (PI) by injection, 10 patients with asthma due to HDM were studied in a blind fashion. 5 patients (Group A) underwent LI and subcutaneous injections of placebo, 5 patients (Group B) underwent PI and inhalation of lactose for 6 months. In both groups each inhalation was preceded by premedication with disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) (40 mg). In Group A a significant decrease in symptoms score and in peak expiratory flow (PEF)-derived parameters was observed already after 3 months of treatment, and 2 patients lost the late component of the bronchial response to the challenge with HDM. No significant variation was found in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and ultrasonically nebulized distilled water (UNDW) and in immunologic humoral and cellular parameters in peripheral blood after treatment in either group. No local important adverse reactions were observed in Group A and no systemic side effects were observed in either group. We conclude that LI is as effective as PI, but more rapid in its action, in the treatment of asthma due to HDM. Moreover, LI is locally well tolerated, providing DSCG is inhaled before each therapeutic inhalation, and does not induce systemic side effects.\n",

      "Pain following traumatic injuries is common, can impair injury recovery and is often inadequately treated. In particular, the role of adjunctive nonpharmacologic analgesic techniques is unclear. The authors report a randomized, controlled study of 21 hospitalized trauma patients to assess the analgesic efficacy of virtual reality hypnosis (VRH)-hypnotic induction and analgesic suggestion delivered by customized virtual reality (VR) hardware/software. Subjective pain ratings were obtained immediately and 8 hours after VRH (used as an adjunct to standard analgesic care) and compared to both adjunctive VR without hypnosis and standard care alone. VRH patients reported less pain intensity and less pain unpleasantness compared to control groups. These preliminary findings suggest that VRH analgesia is a novel technology worthy of further study, both to improve pain management and to increase availability of hypnotic analgesia to populations without access to therapist-provided hypnosis and suggestion.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE To explore the short-term treatment effect of the auditory integrative training on autistic children and provide them with clinical support for rehabilitative treatment.\n",
      "METHODS A total of 81 cases of autistic children were selected through the standard of DSM-4 and clinical case study was used. They were divided randomly into experimental group and control one, and respectively received auditory integrative training and no training based on the multiple therapies. The patients were investigated using clinical manifestation and Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) and intelligence quotient (IQ) before and after six months of treatment. The effect was evaluated through the changes of clinical manifestations and scores of ABC and IQ. The changes of scores of IQ were determined with Gesell and WPPSI or WISC-R.\n",
      "RESULTS Compared with 40 patients of the control group after the six months of the auditory integrative training, 41 of the experimental group had greatly improved in many aspects, such as the disorders of their language, social interactions and typical behavior symptoms while they had not changed in their abnormal behaviors. The scores of IQ or DQ had increased and scores of ABC had dropped. The differences between the two groups were greatly significant in statistics (P < 0.01). The decreasing level of both ABC scores and the increasing level of the IQ scores were negatively correlated with age, and the decreasing level of ABC scores was in line regression(positive correlation) with base IQ.\n",
      "CONCLUSION The treatment of auditory integrative training (AIT) could greatly improve on language disorders, the difficulties of social interactions, typical behavior symptoms and developmental levels,therefore it is positive to the autistic children in its short-term treatment effect.\n",

The time between stroke and the beginning of walking was not significantly different between both groups. Gait velocity increased significantly between JM and JM + 30 in both groups, with no difference between groups. The walking pattern was improved for both groups, with a significant increase of the duration of the paretic limb single stance.

      "PURPOSE Nearly 2000 patients with stage IIB and III melanoma have participated in four multicenter, randomized trials, conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the Intergroup, investigating adjuvant high-dose IFN-alpha 2b therapy. The objectives of this study were to update the analyses of each individual trial and to analyze prognostic factors and treatment effects based on pooled data.\n",
      "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Survival and disease status were updated to April 2001. Analysis of prognostic factors using optimized statistical models was based on data from patients in E1684, E1690, E1694, and E2696. Analysis of treatment effects versus observation (Obs) was based on data from 713 patients randomized to high-dose IFN-alpha 2b (HDI) or Obs in Trials E1684 and E1690.\n",
      "RESULTS Updated analysis of E1684, E1690, and E1694 confirmed their original conclusions, now at median follow-up intervals of 2.1-12.6 years. Based on two-sided univariate log-rank analysis of pooled data from E1684 and E1690 (median follow-up, 7.2 years), relapse-free survival (RFS)-but not overall survival (OS)-was significantly prolonged (two-sided log-rank P value = 0.006) for patients treated with HDI versus Obs. Among all patients, prognostic factors that significantly negatively impacted RFS and OS included ulceration, recurrent disease at entry, enrollment in E1684, and age > 49 years. Multivariate statistical models adjusting for these factors confirmed the statistically significant RFS benefit of HDI versus Obs but did not demonstrate a significant OS benefit in the pooled populations.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS In patients with high-risk resected melanoma, HDI is effective adjuvant therapy with strong evidence for improved RFS and evidence for moderate improvement in OS based on two prospective randomized studies but not the pooled analysis. Analyses of predictors of relapse and response are now needed to improve the therapeutic value of this modality.\n",

      "\n",
      "Changes in continuously recorded 'Finapres' finger blood pressure in ten normotensive and seven hypertensive subjects induced by self-inflation of the cuff or just wearing the inflated cuff were studied. Inflating the cuff caused an instantaneous rise in systolic blood pressure of 13 and 12 mm Hg (hypertensive and normotensive subjects, respectively). Wearing the inflated cuff did not change blood pressure. Thus the rise in pressure was related to the muscular activity required for cuff inflation. Systolic blood pressure took on average 7 s and at most 21 s to return to baseline level after stopping cuff inflation. Since first Korotkoff sounds may already be heard after 10-15 s when following recommended procedures, self-recorded systolic blood pressure may be recorded as too high when subjects inflate their cuff at too low a pressure or deflate it too fast.\n",

Additionally, a prospective clinical study was conducted in 77 patients with CDAD to demonstrate the safety of consuming anti-CD WPC to prevent relapse of the infection. This study, which included adverse event monitoring, physical examinations, and extensive hematological and biochemical assessments, showed that anti-CD WPC is safe to consume by patients with CDAD. The available analytical and clinical evidence demonstrate that anti-CD WPC is safe for use by individuals with CDAD, under the described conditions of use.\n",

Limited research suggests that intake of soy products high in isoflavonoid phytoestrogens affects sex hormone metabolism, but it is unknown whether phytoestrogens in soy have any effect on menstrual function or serum sex hormones in women on common hormone therapies, such as oral contraceptives (OC). We studied the effects of soy in 36 premenopausal women, 20 of whom used OC. Subjects consumed their normal diet for two menstrual cycles and added a soy beverage containing 20 g of protein and 38 mg of total isoflavones to their usual diet for another two menstrual cycles. No significant differences were observed in serum estrone, estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, prolactin, or progesterone concentrations with soy feeding in the non-OC or the OC group. No changes in menstrual cycle length or the urinary estrogen metabolite ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone to 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone were seen with soy feeding in the non-OC or the OC group. Levels of urinary estrogen metabolites were significantly different between the non-OC and the OC group.

The randomized, double-blinded, crossover study comprised 30 healthy children. There were two 3-week study periods with a 4-week wash-out period in between. The children ingested daily 65 ml of milk-based fruit juice containing either LGG alone (6.5 x 10(9) CFU) or LGG plus 2 g of GOS. Symptom diaries were filled during the study periods. Fecal samples were collected at the beginning and end of both study periods. At the end of both study periods, the amount of bifidobacteria was significantly greater after the ingestion of LGG + GOS compared with LGG alone (geometric mean 9.33 x 10(9) vs. 4.28 x 10(9) CFU/g, p < 0.001). No significant differences were seen in the amount of lactobacilli or LGG, nor did gastrointestinal symptoms, defecation frequency, consistency of stools or ease of defecation differ between the two study periods. Ingestion of LGG combined with 2 g of GOS increased the bifidobacteria more than LGG on its own and thus GOS clearly has a prebiotic effect in children.

      "RESULTS Three hundred sixty-five patients were enrolled. One hundred eighty-three patients were assigned to the 40K arm, and 182 were assigned to the 120K arm. There was no difference in the proportion of patients requiring transfusions during the study (23% in 40K arm and 18% in 120K arm, P = .22) or specifically during the maintenance phase (13% in 40K arm v 15% in 120K arm, P = .58). Patients randomly assigned to the 40K arm were more likely to have a > or = 2 or > or = 3 g/dL hemoglobin (Hb) increment, were more likely to have a drug dose held because of high Hb, and had higher mean end-of-study Hb levels. Toxicities, including thromboembolism, and overall survival were similar. Patients in the 40K arm had a higher global quality of life (QOL) at baseline for unclear reasons, whereas patients in the 120K arm had a greater global QOL improvement during the study, so end-of-study QOL was equivalent.\n",

Each of the four measurement devices had its own trained clinical observer. Plots of differences of IOP as a function of the mean for each pair of instruments were obtained. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the AT550 NCT with contact applanation tonometry (AT) (p> 0.05), displaying the closest level of agreement (as represented by the lowest mean difference and the narrowest confidence interval) with the Goldmann tonometer (limits of agreement, 0.12+/-2.17). In conclusion, readings of IOP with the AT550 NCT are clinically comparable with those obtained with Goldmann tonometry in a population with IOP within the normal range.\n",

      "\n",
      "SUMMARY The effect of garlic and onion on alimentary hyperlipemia, induced by feeding 100 g butter, has been studied in 10 healthy subjects. The freshly extracted juice of 50 g of garlic or onion, as well as an equivalent amount of their ether-extracted essential oils, was administered randomly on four different days during a one-week period. Garlic and onion have a significant protective action against fat-induced increases in serum cholesterol and plasma fibrinogen and decreases in coagulation time and fibrinolytic activity. The essential oil fraction, which contains all the taste and odour, exactly duplicated the beneficial effects of whole garlic and onion. It is, therefore, concluded that the active principle of garlic and onion is the essential oil, which chemically is a combination of sulphur-containing compounds, mainly allyl propyl disulphide and diallyl disulphide.\n",

      "The role of somatostatin (octreotide) in the regulation of melatonin secretion in healthy volunteers and in patients with primary hypothyroidism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somatostatin has been found in the pineal gland of several animal species, which suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of melatonin secretion. Whether somatostatin has regulatory influence on melatonin secretion in man has never been unequivocally shown. We studied the nocturnal melatonin secretion in 8 healthy volunteers, and 6 women with untreated primary hypothyroidism, a disease state that is associated with increased nocturnal secretion of melatonin. The participants were given subcutaneous injections at 18:00 h and 23:00 h of either saline or octreotide (Sandostatin; each injection 50 microg). During the nights when the healthy volunteers were given octreotide, melatonin secretion was similar to that recorded during administration of saline. Also the urinary excretion of melatonin was of similar magnitude at these two occasions. By contrast, the GH secretion was significantly lower the nights the healthy controls were given octreotide (GH AUC 22.6+/-5.4 mU/l x h during octreotide and 126.6+/-21.9 mU/l x h during saline; p<0.01). The patients with hypothyroidism also showed similar nocturnal melatonin secretion during octreotide and saline. Urinary excretion of melatonin also remained unchanged, as did GH secretion. The total nocturnal secretion of TSH was, however, significantly reduced by octreotide (TSH AUC 562+/-136 mU/l x h during octreotide and 851+/-185 mU/l x h during saline; p<0.05), thus suggesting that 100 microg of octreotide should be sufficient to inhibit also the pinealocytes if their function were regulated by somatostatin. Since exogenous somatostatin--in the form of octreotide--fails to influence nocturnal secretion and urinary excretion of melatonin in normal subjects and in patients with primary hypothyroidism, it is reasonable to assume that endogenous somatostatin may not be an important regulator of melatonin secretion in man.\n",

      "\n",
      "Although root instrumentation has been accepted as the most important cause-related treatment of periodontal diseases, repeated scaling and root planing may over time result in substantive loss of tooth substance and increased sensitivity of the teeth. In an effort to minimize these side effects of therapy, non-root substance removing curettes have been developed. However, the clinical effects of such plastic curettes with regard to the control of the periodontal infection has not yet been established. The aims of this study were, therefore, to compare the effects of root instrumentation using plastic curettes (Universal Perio Soft Scaler, Hawe-Neos Dental, Bioggio, TI, Switzerland) versus conventional steel curettes on the periodontal conditions during supportive periodontal therapy. 40 subjects participated in this parallel, randomized, double blind, prospective longitudinal clinical study following active peridontal therapy. 20 subjects served as a control group and were treated with conventional steel curettes during a supportive periodontal care visit (SPT). The other 20 subjects, the experimental group, were treated using plastic curettes during a similar SPT visit. Clinical parameters, such as bleeding on probing (BOP) and probing pocket depth (PPD), were assessed at baseline and 3-6 months later at the next regular SPT visit. In addition, the BOP percentage was determined 10 days following baseline. The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment modalities regarding BOP and PPD at any observation time. Both treatments were effective in reducing the BOP percentage which ranged from 17-42% at baseline by about 40% after 10 days (mean BOP baseline: 26%, mean BOP after 10 days: 16%). This clinical study suggests that non-root substance removing curettes may be valuable instruments for periodontally treated patients during maintenance care, thus minimizing trauma on the hard structures of the teeth.\n",

In this double-blind study, we randomised 98 patients to receive cophenylcaine or placebo nasal spray before flexible nasendoscopy. A visual analogue scale (1-100) was used to record pain, unpleasantness of taste and overall discomfort experienced. Overall, the procedure was associated with minimal pain and discomfort in both groups. There was no significant difference in pain or overall discomfort experienced between the two groups; however, the sensation of bad taste was significantly worse in the cophenylcaine group. In linear regression, factors that predicted the overall unpleasantness of the experience were primarily pain experienced and secondarily unpleasantness of taste. We conclude that the routine use of cophenylcaine for nasal preparation is not justified before flexible nasendoscopy.\n",

Seventeen patients on chronic digitalis and diuretic therapy were randomized to receive either flosequinan (n = 9) or placebo (n = 8) in a double-blind fashion. Changes in symptomatology, exercise performance, and left ventricular function were assessed serially during the two-month treatment period. During the course of therapy, a modest improvement in the symptom scores and functional classification of the flosequinan-treated patients was observed. Flosequinan evoked a significant increase in maximal exercise capacity. While long-term flosequinan administration also effected a progressive increase in resting heart rate, it did not consistently improve indices of left ventricular systolic function. The addition of chronic vasodilator therapy with flosequinan to standard digitalis-diuretic regimens is capable of inducing clinical improvement in patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure.

      "The effects of 12 weeks of antioxidant supplementation on exercise-induced oxidative stress were investigated in older adults (60 (SE 1) years; BMI 26 (SE 1) kg/m(2)). Subjects were randomly divided in two groups: supplementation (n 11) with 100 mg dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, 200 mg ascorbic acid, and 2 mg beta-carotene, and placebo (n 9). Before and after the 12 week supplementation period, subjects cycled for 45 min at submaximal intensity (50 % maximal workload capacity). Antipyrine was used as marker for oxidative stress. Antipyrine reacts quickly with hydroxyl radicals to form para- and ortho-hydroxyantipyrine. The latter metabolite is not formed in man through the mono-oxygenase pathway of cytochrome P450. Daily supplementation significantly increased plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene in the supplemented group (Delta 14.4 (SE 3.2) and 0.4 (se 0.1) micromol/l; P<0.001 and P<0.01). No significant differences, within and between groups, were observed in the exercise-induced increase in the ratios para- and ortho-hydroxyantipyrine to antipyrine. In addition, supplementation did not affect the exercise-induced increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in plasma. In conclusion, in 60-year-old subjects antioxidant supplementation had no effect on the exercise-induced increase in oxidative stress as measured by free radical products of antipyrine.\n",

Similar dosage and fractionation of RT was administered in both arms. The investigational arm received two cycles of concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin 20 mg/m(2)/d plus fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2)/d by 96-hour continuous infusion during the weeks 1 and 5 of RT. Survival analysis was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test.\n",
      "RESULTS Baseline patient characteristics were comparable in both arms. After a median follow-up of 65 months, 26.2% (37 of 141) and 46.2% (66 of 143) of patients developed tumor relapse in the CCRT and RT-alone groups, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rates were 72.3% for the CCRT arm and 54.2% for the RT-only arm (P =.0022). The 5-year progression-free survival rates were 71.6% for the CCRT group compared with 53.0% for the RT-only group (P =.0012). Although significantly more toxicity was noted in the CCRT arm, including leukopenia and emesis, compliance with the combined treatment was good. The second cycle of concurrent chemotherapy was refused by nine patients and was delayed for > or = 1 week for another nine patients. There were no treatment-related deaths in either arm.\n",

      "Neural basis of self and other representation in autism: an FMRI study of self-face recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "BACKGROUND Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by decreased interest and engagement in social interactions and by enhanced self-focus. While previous theoretical approaches to understanding autism have emphasized social impairments and altered interpersonal interactions, there is a recent shift towards understanding the nature of the representation of the self in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Still, the neural mechanisms subserving self-representations in ASD are relatively unexplored.\n",
      "METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We used event-related fMRI to investigate brain responsiveness to images of the subjects' own face and to faces of others. Children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children viewed randomly presented digital morphs between their own face and a gender-matched other face, and made \"self/other\" judgments. Both groups of children activated a right premotor/prefrontal system when identifying images containing a greater percentage of the self face. However, while TD children showed activation of this system during both self- and other-processing, children with ASD only recruited this system while viewing images containing mostly their own face.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE This functional dissociation between the representation of self versus others points to a potential neural substrate for the characteristic self-focus and decreased social understanding exhibited by these individuals, and suggests that individuals with ASD lack the shared neural representations for self and others that TD children and adults possess and may use to understand others.\n",

      "BACKGROUND The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome (AS): The Junior Detective Training Program. This 7-week program included a computer game, small group sessions, parent training sessions and teacher handouts.\n",
      "METHOD Forty-nine children with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention (n = 26) or wait-list control (n = 23) conditions.\n",
      "RESULTS Relative to children in the wait-list group, program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention, as indicated by parent-report measures. Teacher-report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to post-treatment. Treatment group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management strategies for story characters at post-intervention than at pre-intervention, whereas control participants were not. However, there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body-posture recognition measures. Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post-intervention.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS The Junior Detective Training Program appeared to be effective in enhancing the social skills and emotional understanding of children with AS. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.\n",

      "Efficacy and safety of selamectin against fleas and heartworms in dogs and cats presented as veterinary patients in North America.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of randomized, controlled, masked field studies was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of selamectin in the treatment of flea infestations on dogs and cats, and in the prevention of heartworm infection in dogs. In addition, observations were made on the beneficial effect of selamectin treatment on dogs and cats showing signs of flea allergy dermatitis (FAD). In all studies selamectin was applied topically, once per month, in unit doses providing a minimum dosage of 6mgkg(-1). Dogs and cats with naturally occurring flea infestations, some of which also had signs associated with FAD, were assigned randomly to receive three months of topical treatment with selamectin (220 dogs, 189 cats) or a positive-control product (dogs: fenthion, n=81; cats: pyrethrins, n=66). Selamectin was administered on days 0, 30, and 60. Day 0 was defined as the day that the animal first received treatment. Flea burdens were assessed by flea comb counts and clinical evaluations of FAD were performed before treatment, and on days 14, 30, 60, and 90. On days 30, 60, and 90, mean flea counts in selamectin-treated dogs were reduced by 92.1, 99.0, and 99.8%, and mean flea counts in fenthion-treated dogs were reduced by 81.5, 86.8, and 86.1%, respectively, compared with day 0 counts. Also, on days 30, 60, and 90, mean flea counts in selamectin-treated cats were reduced by 92.5, 98.3, and 99.3%, and mean flea counts in pyrethrin-treated cats were reduced by 66.4, 73.9, and 81.3%, respectively, compared with day 0 counts. Selamectin also was beneficial in alleviating signs in dogs and cats diagnosed clinically with FAD. A total of 397 dogs free of adult heartworm infection from four heartworm-endemic areas of the USA were allocated randomly to six months of treatment with selamectin (n=298) or ivermectin (n=99). Selamectin achieved a heartworm prevention rate of 100%, with all dogs testing negative for microfilariae and adult heartworm antigen on days 180 and 300. Selamectin was administered to a total of 673 dogs and 347 cats having an age range of 6 weeks to 19 years (3954 doses). The animals included 19 purebred or crossbred Collies (Bearded, Border, and unspecified). There were no serious adverse events. Results of these studies indicated that selamectin was highly effective in the control of flea infestations in dogs and cats without the need for simultaneous treatment of the environment or of in-contact animals and also was beneficial in alleviating signs associated with FAD. Selamectin also was 100% effective in preventing the development of canine heartworms and was safe for topical use in dogs and cats.\n",

      "AIM The study aimed to test simultaneously our understanding of the effects of bupropion sustained-release (SR) treatment on putative mediators and our understanding of determinants of post-quit abstinence, including withdrawal distress, cigarette craving, positive affect and subjective reactions to cigarettes smoked during a lapse. The specificity of bupropion SR effects was also tested in exploratory analyses.\n",

      "PARTICIPANTS A total of 403 adult, daily smokers without contraindications to bupropion SR use.\n",
      "INTERVENTION Participants were assigned randomly to receive a 9-week course of bupropion SR or placebo pill and to receive eight brief individual counseling sessions or no counseling.\n",
      "MEASUREMENTS Ecological momentary assessment ratings of smoking behavior and putative mediators were collected pre- and post-quit.\n",
      "FINDINGS Results of structural equation and hierarchical linear models did not support the hypothesis that bupropion SR treatment improves short-term abstinence by reducing withdrawal distress or affecting the subjective effects of a lapse cigarette, but provided partial support for mediation by cigarette craving reduction and enhanced positive affect. Bupropion SR effects on point-prevalence abstinence at 1 month post-quit were also mediated partially by enhanced motivation to quit and self-efficacy.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS Results provided some support for models of bupropion SR treatment and relapse and suggested that motivational processes may partially account for bupropion SR efficacy.\n",
