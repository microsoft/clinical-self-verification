      "\n",
      "Women who smoke and take oral contraceptives (OCs) have significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but the exact mechanismsfor the increased risk are not known. Cardiovascular reactivity to psychological stress may be one mechanism for the enhanced risk, but the small number of studies examining whether OC users who smoke have greater reactivity have produced mixed results. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of chronic cigarette smoking, acute nicotine administration, and OC use on cardiovascular and lipid reactivity. Sixty healthy women, half of whom had been using OCs for at least the previous 6 months, participated in the study. Approximately two thirds were smokers and were randomized to be tested after either a 12-hr nicotine deprivation or administration of nicotine gum. One third were nonsmokers. Heart rate, blood pressure, and lipid measures were taken at rest, during a videotaped speech task, and during recovery from the task. Results indicated that, among OC nonusers, there was no effect of smoking status or nicotine administration on cardiovascular reactivity. However, among OC users, nonsmokers had significantly greater heart rate and diastolic blood pressure reactivity to stress. These data show that acute nicotine administration, in the form of nicotine gum, has no effect on cardiovascular or lipid stress reactivity in women. However OC use among nonsmoking women is associated with greater cardiovascular reactivity to stress.\n",

      "\n",
      "Parents of children who receive the diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) experience a situational crisis related to receiving the diagnosis, which causes feelings of distress and urgency to access services for the affected child. This paper describes a randomized trial (n = 31) that was conducted at a regional diagnostic center of a large metropolitan children's hospital to (a) refine a nursing intervention designed for parents of children with ASD and (b) to identify methodological revisions for a larger study. A secondary purpose was to test the effects of a post-diagnosis nursing intervention on parents' reports of stress, impact of event (diagnosis), and use of services after a child is newly diagnosed with ASD. The intervention consisted of usual care plus 3 hours contact with a pediatric nurse practitioner (PNP) for counseling, instruction, and assistance with implementation of the recommended treatment plan. The control group received only the usual care post-diagnosis, which consisted of a 1-hour consultation session to receive the results of diagnostic tests and a written copy of the recommended treatment plan provided by a developmental pediatrician and/or PNP. Between group differences in measures of \"impact of event\" and \"perceived stress\" were not statistically significant. This was attributed to a small sample size. A larger study is feasible and recommended with an expanded nursing intervention and a significantly larger sample recruited from an additional recruitment site. Nurses working with this special population must recognize that parents have information and counseling needs that begin after they receive the diagnosis of ASD for their child and can address these needs with a standardized nursing intervention.\n",

      "Eighty-three patients with small cell lung cancer were randomized with or without using a traditional Chinese Kidney-tonifying decoction (Liu Wei Di Huang or Jin Gui Shen Qi medicinal decoction) in chemotherapy or radiotherapy courses. 74 patients were availble to be analysis. The two treatment groups were well-matched in age, sex, stage and performance status. There was a statistically significant difference in response rate and the median survival between two groups. The overall response rate (CR+PR) was 91.5% for Chinese herb group and 46.9% for control group (P less than 0.001). The median survival was 16 months for the traditional Chinese Kidney-tonifying decoction group, and 10 months for the control group (P less than 0.05). Survival curve (Kaplan-meire's) of the Chinese herb group was better than that of the control group. 10 patients of Chinese herb group was alive beyond more than 2 years. Until now, 4 patients in the Chinese herb group, one in the control group are still enjoying their disease-free life for more than 7 years. Hematologic toxicities were observed much frequently in the patients of the control group (P less than 0.005 and 0.01/WBC and BPC). Results of animal experiments with the same traditional medicinal decoctions as used in clinic have showed immuno-enhancement activities. These results have showed that the traditional Chinese Kidney-tonifying decoction may enhance non-specific immunology activities and may be much useful for solid cancer patients as an adjuvant treatment.\n",

      "SUMMARY This study examined whether 24 months of weight training exercises enhanced the effectiveness of risedronate, calcium, and vitamin D in maintaining or improving bone mineral density (BMD) in 223 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Subjects who were > or =50% adherent to exercise had no improvement in BMD but were less likely to lose BMD.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION This study examined whether (1) postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (BCS) with bone loss taking 24 months of risedronate, calcium, and vitamin D had increased bone mineral density (BMD) at the total hip, femoral neck, L1-L4 spine, total radius and 33% radius, and decreased bone turnover; (2) subjects who also participated in strength/weight training (ST) exercises had greater increases in BMD and greater decreases in bone turnover; and (3) subjects who also exercised were more likely to preserve (at least maintain) BMD.\n",
      "METHODS Postmenopausal BCS (223) were randomly assigned to exercise plus medication or medication only groups. Both groups received 24 months of 1,200 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D daily and 35 mg of risedronate weekly, and the exercise group additionally had ST exercises twice weekly.\n",
      "RESULTS After 24 months, women who took medications without exercising had significant improvements in BMD at the total hip (+1.81%) and spine (+2.85%) and significant decreases in Alkphase B (-8.7%) and serum NTx (-16.7%). Women who also exercised had additional increases in BMD at the femoral neck (+0.29%), total hip (+0.34%), spine (+0.23%), total radius (+0.30%), and additional decreases in Alkphase B (-2.4%) and Serum NTx (-6.5%). Additional changes in BMD and bone turnover with exercise were not significant. Subjects who were > or =50% adherent to exercise were less likely to lose BMD at the total hip (chi-square [1] = 4.66, p = 0.03) and femoral neck (chi-square [1] = 4.63, p = 0.03).\n",

      "\n",
      "Addition of epirubicin to adjuvant chemotherapy can provide important benefits for patients with early breast cancer, but the optimal dose remains unclear. Further improvements can be achieved with dose-dense regimens, but densification of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) has proved difficult, with FEC(60) providing little benefit over standard chemotherapy and FEC(100) associated with toxicity. We investigated the feasibility of two intermediate dose-dense FEC regimens. Patients were randomised to six cycles of FEC(75) or FEC(90), with all three drugs given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle. Patients also received pegfilgrastim 6 mg as a single subcutaneous injection on day 2 of each cycle. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects receiving > or =85% relative dose intensity and was achieved by 96% and 88% of patients in the FEC(75) and FEC(90) arms, respectively. Of 147 FEC(75) infusions, 4.1% were delayed, while 9.8% of 143 FEC(90) infusions were delayed. The most common reasons for delay were adverse events and personal/logistical reasons. One dose reduction occurred during the study (FEC(90)), related to diarrhoea. Grade 3-4 haematological toxicities were reported in two patients in the FEC(90) arm. There were no incidences of febrile neutropenia during the study. The most common adverse events were increases in liver enzymes and gastrointestinal events; no event resulted in discontinuation. Only one patient (FEC(90)) experienced serious adverse events (vomiting and throat oedema). In conclusion, dose-dense FEC(75 )and FEC(90) are feasible with pegfilgrastim support. These regimens are associated with a very low risk of Grade 3-4 toxicity.\n",

      "BACKGROUND We aimed to analyze clinical, microbiologic, and serologic effects of chlorhexidine (CHX) chips used as a subgingival controlled-release delivery device before and immediately after scaling and root planing (SRP).\n",
      "METHODS Twenty-four patients presenting with ≥12 teeth with probing depth (PD) ≥5 mm and bleeding on probing were assigned in test or control groups. After prophylaxis, CHX chips (test) or placebo chips (control) were placed in pockets with PD ≥5 mm. Ten days later, SRP was performed in all teeth with PD ≥4 mm in a single appointment. Immediately after SRP, new chips were inserted in all pockets with PD ≥5 mm. Parameters were assessed at baseline; beginning of SRP; and 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Subgingival samples were obtained at baseline; beginning of SRP; and at 1 month after treatment. Periodontal pathogens Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were analyzed. Serum levels of high sensitive C-reactive and lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins were measured. The changes of the parameters between and within the groups were tested by Mann-Whitney U test (P <0.05).\n",
      "RESULTS All clinical and serologic parameters improved in both groups over time. There was a significant difference in clinical attachment level (CAL) gain from baseline to 6 months between groups (1.17 mm in the test group versus 0.79 mm in the placebo group) (P <0.05). The treatment with CHX chips showed a greater reduction of the microorganisms of the \"red complex\" after 1 month (P = 0.02).\n",

Besides, the integral difference between before and after drug therapy was higher in the test group than in the control group [(9.12 +/- 6.16) score vs (3.48 +/- 2.06) score)], showing statistical difference (P<0.05). After three-month drug therapy, the serum EMAb negative conversion rate was obviously higher in the test group than in the control group (44.44% vs 15.62%), showing statistical difference (P<0.05). The serum CA125 level was (31.88 +/- 15.78) U/mL before drug therapy and (18.82 +/- 10.08) U/mL three months after drug therapy in the test group, while it was (30.63 +/- 19.28) U/mL and (18.05 +/- 11.20) U/mL respectively in the control group. It was lowered after drug therapy in the two groups with statistical difference (P<0.05). There was no statistical difference between the two groups after drug therapy (P>0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic surgery in combination of QYJDR could effectively improve clinical symptoms of EMs patients of blood stasis and toxin accumulation syndrome, promote negative conversion of EMAb, lower serum CA125 levels, and elevate the clinical pregnancy rate. QYJDR is an effective formula in treatment of EMs-related infertility.\n",

      "A double-blind, randomized, controlled, multicenter safety and immunogenicity study of a refrigerator-stable formulation of Zostavax.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vaccine Zostavax has been shown to prevent herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia and is recommended for individuals > or =60 years of age. This study compared the safety and the immunogenicity of a refrigerator-stable formulation (Zostavax refrigerated) with those of the current formulation (Zostavax frozen) in subjects > or =50 years of age. Subjects with a negative history for HZ were randomized 1:1 to receive one dose of either formulation. Enrollment was stratified 1:2 by age (50 to 59 years and > or =60 years). Safety was evaluated for 28 days postvaccination. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody responses were measured by a glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA). The primary endpoints were the VZV antibody geometric mean titer (GMT; day 28), the VZV antibody geometric mean rise (GMR; days 1 to 28), and the incidence of vaccine-related serious adverse experiences (AEs) over 28 days. The refrigerated (n = 182) and frozen (n = 185) formulations induced similar GMTs (727.4 and 834.4 gpELISA units/ml, respectively); the estimated GMT ratio (refrigerated formulation/frozen formulation) was 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.71 to 1.07). The GMRs were 2.6- and 2.9-fold, respectively. No vaccine-related serious AEs were reported in either group, and the safety profiles of the formulations were generally similar. The frequencies of injection-site AEs during follow-up were 35.6% and 46.4% in the refrigerated and the frozen formulation groups, respectively, and were generally mild. The frequencies of systemic AEs were similar in the two groups, and those of vaccine-related AEs were approximately 6% in both groups. The refrigerator-stable formulation of Zostavax has an acceptable safety profile and is as immunogenic as the frozen formulation; thus, the vaccine may be used in clinical settings where freezer availability is limited.\n",

      "Time-varying smoking abstinence predicts lower depressive symptoms following smoking cessation treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "INTRODUCTION The question of whether abstinence during the months following a planned quit attempt exacerbates or improves depressive symptoms is an important clinical issue. Extant research has primarily modeled between-person covariation between postquit abstinence and depressive symptom trajectories. However, this approach cannot account for potential third variables between participants that may affect both smoking and depression. Accordingly, the current study examined within-person covariation between time-varying abstinence and depressive symptom in a multilevel model (MLM), which allowed for transitions between smoking statuses within a participant.\n",
      "METHODS Participants were 236 heavy drinking smokers in a randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of incorporating brief alcohol intervention into smoking cessation treatment. Depressive symptoms and biochemically verified abstinence were assessed 1 week prior to and 2, 8, 16, and 26 weeks after quit date.\n",
      "RESULTS MLMs indicated a slight increase in depressive symptoms over time in the sample as a whole. However, there was an inverse relation between time-varying abstinence (vs. smoking) and concurrent level of depressive symptoms, indicating that transitions from smoking to abstinence within individuals were associated with reductions in depressive symptoms.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS During the first 6 months following a planned quit attempt, being abstinent in a particular week appears to be associated with lower levels of concurrent depressive symptoms. These results are not concordant with the view that intentional smoking abstinence exacerbates depressive symptoms. Efforts to promote smoking cessation should highlight that individuals are likely to feel more rather than less psychologically healthy when they successfully quit smoking.\n",

      "Quality of individual INR control and the risk of stroke and bleeding events in atrial fibrillation patients: a nested case control analysis of the ACTIVE W study.\n",
      "\n",
      "INTRODUCTION Time in therapeutic range (TTR) for international normalized ratio (INR) is an accepted quality measure of anticoagulation control in patient populations, but its usefulness for predicting stroke and bleeding in individuals is not well understood.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS In a nested case control analysis among ACTIVE W study patients, cases with stroke and cases with bleeding were separately matched with controls. Several anticoagulation quality measures were compared, overall and in a time-dependent manner.\n",
      "RESULTS 32 cases with ischemic stroke and 234 cases with bleeding in the analysis were matched in a 4:1 ratio to 122 and 865 controls, respectively. Follow-up duration was 257±154days for the stroke analysis and 222±146days for the bleeding analysis. Compared with their respective controls, the study mean TTR of both stroke cases (53.9%±25.1 vs 63.4%±24.8; p=0.055) and bleeding cases (56.2%±25.4 vs 63.4%±26.8; p<0.001) was lower. Time below range for stroke and time above range for bleeding were only greater in the last month leading up to the event, not over the entire study period. Rather, over the entire study period bleeding cases spent more time below range than controls (26.8%±25.9 vs 20.8%±24.0; p=0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS TTR was lower in individual AF patients with stroke or bleeding compared with matched controls in ACTIVE W. Maintaining a high TTR, with equal importance to avoid low and high INRs, is a relevant goal of individual patient treatment to prevent stroke and bleeding.\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper presents the rationale for a 24-week, randomized trial designed to test whether risperidone plus structured parent training would be superior to risperidone only on measures of noncompliance, irritability and adaptive functioning. In this model, medication reduces tantrums, aggression and self-injury; parent training promotes improvement in noncompliance and adaptive functioning. Thus, medication and parent training target related, but separate, outcomes. At week 24, the medication was gradually withdrawn to determine whether subjects in the combined treatment group could be managed on a lower dose or off medication without relapse. Both symptom reduction and functional improvement are important clinical treatment targets. Thus, experimental evidence on the beneficial effects of combining pharmacotherapy and exportable behavioral interventions is needed to guide clinical practice.\n",

      "Vibrotactile--auditory interactions are post-perceptual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vibrotactile stimuli can elicit compelling auditory sensations, even when sound energy levels are minimal and undetectable. It has previously been shown that subjects judge auditory tones embedded in white noise to be louder when they are accompanied by a vibrotactile stimulus of the same frequency. A first experiment replicated this result at four different levels of auditory stimulation (no tone, tone at detection threshold, tone at 5 dB above threshold, and tone at 10 dB above threshold). The presence of a vibrotactile stimulus induced an increase in the perceived loudness of auditory tones at three of the four values in this range. In two further experiments, a 2-interval forced-choice procedure was used to assess the nature of this cross-modal interaction. Subjects were biased when vibrotaction was applied in one interval, but applying vibrotaction in both intervals produced performance comparable to conditions without vibrotactile stimuli. This demonstrates that vibrotaction is sometimes ignored when judging the presence of an auditory tone. Hence the interaction between vibrotaction and audition does not appear to occur at an early perceptual level.\n",

      "\n",
      "BACKGROUND One of the reasons physiotherapy services are provided to emergency departments (EDs) and emergency extended care units (EECUs) is to review patients' mobility to ensure they are safe to be discharged home.\n",
      "AIM To investigate whether a physiotherapy service to an EECU altered the rate of hospital admission, rate of re-presentation to the ED, visits to community healthcare practitioners, return to usual work/home/leisure activities and patient satisfaction.\n",
      "METHODS A randomised trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken in an EECU. The sample comprised 186 patients (mean age 70 years, 123 (66%) female patients, 130 (70%) trauma) who were referred for physiotherapy assessment/intervention. Referral occurred at any stage of the patients' EECU admission. All participants received medical/nursing care as required. The physiotherapy group also received physiotherapy assessment/intervention.\n",
      "RESULTS The physiotherapy group had a 4% (95% CI -18% to 9%) lower rate of admission to hospital than the control group and a 4% (95% CI -6% to 13%) higher rate of re-presentation to the ED, which were statistically non-significant (p≥0.45). Differences between groups for use of community healthcare resources, return to usual work/home/leisure activities and satisfaction with their EECU care were small and not significant.\n",

      "\n",
      "BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in association with myoelectrical dysrhythmia, where different types of gastric electrical activity have been described. These types of gastric myoelectrical activity and dysrhythmia can be measured by electrogastrography using cutaneous electrodes. Epigastric impedance is a non-invasive method used to study gastric emptying time and gastric phasic activity. At present no study of gastric dysrhythmia, measured with epigastric impedance, has been presented, and the purpose of the present study was to investigate gastric rhythms by means of impedance gastrography in control infants, compared to infants with different gastrointestinal diseases, before and after treatment of their disease.\n",
      "METHOD 21 patients (age 0-2 months) and 40 healthy infants (age 0-2 months) were investigated. The patients suffered from partial or total intestinal obstruction, necrotizing enterocolitis or pyloric stenosis.All infants were fasting and studied during periods of at least one hour. The patients were examined in the acute state and after treatment when possible.\n",
      "RESULTS A pathologic result was found in 90% of the patients. A persistent phasic activity pattern was found in 19 of the 21 patients, high frequency phasic activity in 11 of the 21 patients. Short-term phasic activity was only found in 13 out of 40 of the normal infants (32.5%).\n",
      "CONCLUSION Using epigastric impedance we found that infants with partial or total intestinal obstruction had gastric phasic activity, which was not found in the control infants. The origin of the gastric phasic activity patterns is unknown, but they may be related to electrical control activity.\n",

      "BACKGROUND Few studies have compared treatment strategies in patients with asthma poorly controlled on low dose inhaled corticosteroids, and little is known about the effects of different treatments on airway inflammation. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, we compared the effects of salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate (FP) (Seretide; SFC) and FP plus montelukast (FP/M) on sputum inflammatory markers, airway responsiveness, lung function, and symptoms in adult asthmatics.\n",
      "METHODS Sixty-six subjects were randomised to SFC or FP/M for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was changes in neutrophil, eosinophil, macrophage, lymphocyte, and epithelial cell levels in induced sputum. Additional outcomes included the change in other sputum markers of airway inflammation, airway responsiveness, symptom control, and lung function.\n",
      "RESULTS Both treatments had no significant effect on induced sputum inflammatory cells, although there was a trend for a reduction in sputum eosinophils. Both treatments significantly improved airway responsiveness, whereas SFC generally led to greater improvements in symptom control and lung function than FP/M. FP/M led to significantly greater reductions in sputum cysteinyl leukotrienes than SFC (treatment ratio 1.80; 95% CI 1.09, 2.94).\n",

      "BACKGROUND Hormonal contraceptives are used widely but their effects on HIV-1 risk are unclear. We aimed to assess the association between hormonal contraceptive use and risk of HIV-1 acquisition by women and HIV-1 transmission from HIV-1-infected women to their male partners.\n",
      "METHODS In this prospective study, we followed up 3790 heterosexual HIV-1-serodiscordant couples participating in two longitudinal studies of HIV-1 incidence in seven African countries. Among injectable and oral hormonal contraceptive users and non-users, we compared rates of HIV-1 acquisition by women and HIV-1 transmission from women to men. The primary outcome measure was HIV-1 seroconversion. We used Cox proportional hazards regression and marginal structural modelling to assess the effect of contraceptive use on HIV-1 risk.\n",
      "FINDINGS Among 1314 couples in which the HIV-1-seronegative partner was female (median follow-up 18·0 [IQR 12·6-24·2] months), rates of HIV-1 acquisition were 6·61 per 100 person-years in women who used hormonal contraception and 3·78 per 100 person-years in those who did not (adjusted hazard ratio 1·98, 95% CI 1·06-3·68, p=0·03). Among 2476 couples in which the HIV-1-seronegative partner was male (median follow-up 18·7 [IQR 12·8-24·2] months), rates of HIV-1 transmission from women to men were 2·61 per 100 person-years in couples in which women used hormonal contraception and 1·51 per 100 person-years in couples in which women did not use hormonal contraception (adjusted hazard ratio 1·97, 95% CI 1·12-3·45, p=0·02). Marginal structural model analyses generated much the same results to the Cox proportional hazards regression.\n",
      "INTERPRETATION Women should be counselled about potentially increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition and transmission with hormonal contraception, especially injectable methods, and about the importance of dual protection with condoms to decrease HIV-1 risk. Non-hormonal or low-dose hormonal contraceptive methods should be considered for women with or at-risk for HIV-1.\n",

      "\n",
      "46 upper and lower molars with furcation grade II involvement were selected from 16 patients with periodontal disease. The teeth were randomly allocated to the following groups according to treatment; (1) 4 consecutive administrations of tetracycline-immobilized cross-linked collagen film (TC film) at intervals of 1 week (TC group); (2) 1 root planing treatment (RP group); (3) combination treatment (TC + RP group); (4) no treatment (control group). The therapeutic effects of each treatment were compared both clinically and microbiologically. Records of plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth, probing attachment level and microscopic counts were obtained at 0, 4, 6 and 8 weeks. The results showed marked decreases in probing depth and density of micro-organisms in both the RP and TC + RP groups. In particular, the TC + RP group was characterized by a decreased rate of bleeding on pocket probing and an increased probing attachment gain. The above findings demonstrated that root planning is effective in the treatment of furcation involvement and that the effects are enhanced by the local administration of TC films.\n",

      "\n",
      "Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may affect blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive patients receiving drug treatment, but data on the effects of low-dose aspirin are scanty. This study assessed the effects of chronic treatment with low doses of aspirin (100 mg/day) on clinic and ambulatory systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP in hypertensives on chronic, stable antihypertensive therapy. The study was conducted in the framework of the Primary Prevention Project (PPP), a randomized, controlled factorial trial on the preventive effect of aspirin or vitamin E in people with one or more cardiovascular risk factors. Fifteen Italian hypertension units studied 142 hypertensive patients (76 men, 66 women; mean age 59 +/- 5.9 years) treated with different antihypertensive drugs: 71 patients were randomized to aspirin and 71 served as controls. All patients underwent a clinic BP evaluation with an automatic sphygmomanometer and a 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, at baseline and after 3 months of aspirin treatment. At the end of the study the changes in clinic SBP and DBP were not statistically different in treated and untreated subjects. Ambulatory SBP and DBP after 3 months of aspirin treatment were similar to baseline: deltaSBP -0.5 mmHg (95% confidence intervals [CI] from -1.9 to +2.9 mm Hg) and deltaDBP -1.1 mm Hg (95% CI from -2.5 to +0.3 mm Hg). The pattern was similar in the control group. No interaction was found between aspirin and the most used antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists). Despite the relatively small sample size our results seem to exclude any significant influence of low-dose aspirin on BP control in hypertensives under treatment.\n",

      "Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are effective for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but are difficult to use. Dabigatran etexilate is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to the active direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. It is administered in a fixed dose without laboratory monitoring and is being compared with warfarin (international normalized ratio 2-3) in the RE-LY trial. Two doses of dabigatran (110 and 150 mg BID) are being evaluated. RE-LY is a phase 3, prospective, randomized, open-label multinational (44 countries) trial of patients with nonvalvular AF and at least 1 risk factor for stroke. Recruitment concluded with a total of 18,113 patients. Patients who were VKA-naive and experienced are included in balanced proportions. The primary outcome is stroke (including hemorrhagic) or systemic embolism. Safety outcomes are bleeding, liver function abnormalities, and other adverse events. Adjudication of end points is blinded to drug assignment. The trial is expected to accrue a minimum of 450 events with a minimum 1-year of follow-up. RE-LY is the largest AF stroke prevention trial yet undertaken. It is unique because it includes equal numbers of VKA-experienced and naive patients and evaluates 2 different dosages of dabigatran, which may allow tailoring of dosing to individual patient needs. The worldwide site distribution and broad range of stroke risk further increase the general applicability of the trial. Results are expected in 2009.\n",

In both groups each inhalation was preceded by premedication with disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) (40 mg). In Group A a significant decrease in symptoms score and in peak expiratory flow (PEF)-derived parameters was observed already after 3 months of treatment, and 2 patients lost the late component of the bronchial response to the challenge with HDM. No significant variation was found in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and ultrasonically nebulized distilled water (UNDW) and in immunologic humoral and cellular parameters in peripheral blood after treatment in either group. No local important adverse reactions were observed in Group A and no systemic side effects were observed in either group. We conclude that LI is as effective as PI, but more rapid in its action, in the treatment of asthma due to HDM. Moreover, LI is locally well tolerated, providing DSCG is inhaled before each therapeutic inhalation, and does not induce systemic side effects.\n",

They were divided randomly into experimental group and control one, and respectively received auditory integrative training and no training based on the multiple therapies. The patients were investigated using clinical manifestation and Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) and intelligence quotient (IQ) before and after six months of treatment. The effect was evaluated through the changes of clinical manifestations and scores of ABC and IQ. The changes of scores of IQ were determined with Gesell and WPPSI or WISC-R.\n",
      "RESULTS Compared with 40 patients of the control group after the six months of the auditory integrative training, 41 of the experimental group had greatly improved in many aspects, such as the disorders of their language, social interactions and typical behavior symptoms while they had not changed in their abnormal behaviors. The scores of IQ or DQ had increased and scores of ABC had dropped. The differences between the two groups were greatly significant in statistics (P < 0.01). The decreasing level of both ABC scores and the increasing level of the IQ scores were negatively correlated with age, and the decreasing level of ABC scores was in line regression(positive correlation) with base IQ.\n",

Patients were stratified prospectively for platinum sensitivity and for the presence or absence of bulky disease.\n",
      "RESULTS A total of 474 patients were treated (239 PLD and 235 topotecan). They comprised the intent-to-treat population. The overall progression-free survival rates were similar between the two arms (P =.095). The overall response rates for PLD and topotecan were 19.7% and 17.0%, respectively (P =.390). Median overall survival times were 60 weeks for PLD and 56.7 weeks for topotecan. Data analyzed in platinum-sensitive patients demonstrated a statistically significant benefit from PLD for progression-free survival (P =.037), with medians of 28.9 for PLD versus 23.3 weeks for topotecan. For overall survival, PLD was significantly superior to topotecan (P =.008), with a median of 108 weeks versus 71.1 weeks.

Severe hematologic toxicity was more common with topotecan and was more likely to be associated with dosage modification, or growth factor or blood product utilization.\n",
      "CONCLUSION The comparable efficacy, favorable safety profile, and convenient dosing support the role of PLD as a valuable treatment option in this patient population.\n",

      "AIMS To compare, in post-acute hemiparetic patients, gait improvement after conventional physical therapy alone or with a specialised balance retraining program.\n",
      "PATIENTS Twenty-six patients within 3 months of onset of stroke were randomised to receive physical therapy (control group) or therapy and retraining (experimental group), most of the patients in both groups with left hemiplegia. The experimental group was significantly older than the control group.\n",
      "METHOD Thirteen patients received early conventional therapy, and 13 received therapy combined with standing balance training by biofeedback (BPM Monitor). Clinical measures were collected at entry (J0), once when subjects began to walk (JM) and 30 days later (JM + 30). Gait spatiotemporal parameters were collected by use of the Vicon system at JM and JM + 30.\n",
      "RESULTS Whatever the method of rehabilitation, the clinical scores improved significantly between J0 and JM + 30, except for spasticity. The time between stroke and the beginning of walking was not significantly different between both groups. Gait velocity increased significantly between JM and JM + 30 in both groups, with no difference between groups. The walking pattern was improved for both groups, with a significant increase of the duration of the paretic limb single stance. The experimental group significantly improved the duration of the reception double stance on the paretic limb between JM and JM + 30 compared with the control group (P = 0.03).\n",
      "CONCLUSION Both groups demonstrated improvement in the rehabilitation unit. The benefits of visual biofeedback by forceplate system training suggest particular improvement of anticipation equilibrium with conventional therapy.\n",

      "BACKGROUND Postoperative epidural analgesia (EA) and femoral nerve block (FNB) provided effective pain relief However, EA has common side effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, dizziness, and hypotension. Some investigations found that those side effects were less in FNB than in EA. However the analgesic equivalent of both techniques have not been confirmed.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE The authors compared continuous epidural infusion (CEI) with continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) regarding the postoperative analgesic efficacy, side effects, postoperative knee rehabilitation, and hospital length of stay (LOS).\n",
      "MATERIAL AND METHOD In this prospective, randomized controlled study, 61 ASA physical status I-III patients scheduled for elective unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) under spinal anesthesia (SA) participated. The patients were allocated into two groups. In the ward, patients in Group I (CEI) were maintained by continuous infusion of 0.125% levobupivacaine with morphine 0.0125 mg/ml (4 ml/hr), Group II (CFNB) were maintained by 0.125% levobupivacaine (8 ml/hr).\n",

      "Studies suggest that phytoestrogens in soy products may impart hormonal effects that protect women against breast cancer. Limited research suggests that intake of soy products high in isoflavonoid phytoestrogens affects sex hormone metabolism, but it is unknown whether phytoestrogens in soy have any effect on menstrual function or serum sex hormones in women on common hormone therapies, such as oral contraceptives (OC). We studied the effects of soy in 36 premenopausal women, 20 of whom used OC. Subjects consumed their normal diet for two menstrual cycles and added a soy beverage containing 20 g of protein and 38 mg of total isoflavones to their usual diet for another two menstrual cycles. No significant differences were observed in serum estrone, estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, prolactin, or progesterone concentrations with soy feeding in the non-OC or the OC group. No changes in menstrual cycle length or the urinary estrogen metabolite ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone to 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone were seen with soy feeding in the non-OC or the OC group. Levels of urinary estrogen metabolites were significantly different between the non-OC and the OC group. Thus soy consumption had no significant effect on the menstrual cycle, serum sex hormones, or urinary estrogen metabolite ratio in premenopausal OC or non-OC users.\n",

      "BACKGROUND Acute invasive diarrhea is a potentially serious condition in children. Because of the increasing resistance of enteric pathogens to commonly used oral antibiotics, intramuscular ceftriaxone has become the routine drug in the treatment of acute invasive diarrhea requiring an emergency visit in southern Israel. The inconvenience of this parenteral regimen created an increased need for oral pediatric formulations for the treatment of invasive diarrhea.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a suspension formulation of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute invasive diarrhea in infants and children.\n",
      "PATIENTS AND METHODS From July 1996 through December 1997, 201 evaluable children ages 6 months to 10 years (35% <1 year; 70% <3 years) presenting with acute invasive diarrhea at the Pediatric Emergency Room were randomized to receive either ciprofloxacin suspension (10 mg/kg twice a day + im placebo; n = 95) or im ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/day + placebo suspension; n = 106) for 3 days in a double blind manner. Stool cultures for Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter spp. and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli were obtained on Days 1, 3, 4 to 5 and 21 +/- 5. Clinical response and safety were assessed on Days 1, 2, 3, 4 to 5 and 21 +/- 5.\n",
      "RESULTS We isolated 127 pathogens from 121 (60%) patients: 73 (57%) Shigella; 23 (18%) Salmonella; 18 (14%) E. coli; and 13 (10%) Campylobacter. Overall bacteriologic eradication on Day 4 to 5 was 99% for Shigella, 77% for Salmonella and 77% for Campylobacter, with no difference between the 2 groups. Clinical cure or improvement was observed in 100 and 99% of the ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone groups, respectively. Serum ciprofloxacin values determined on Day 3 of the treatment were higher in the majority of patients than were the MIC50 and MIC90 values for the Shigella and Salmonella spp. isolated. Possible drug-related adverse events occurred in 13 patients [ciprofloxacin, 8 (8%); ceftriaxone, 5 (4.7%)] and were mild and transient. Joint examination was normal during and after completion of therapy in all patients.\n",

      "The aim of this study was to compare a combination of Lactobacillus GG (LGG) and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) with LGG on its own, and their effects on the intestinal microbiota in school-aged children. The randomized, double-blinded, crossover study comprised 30 healthy children. There were two 3-week study periods with a 4-week wash-out period in between. The children ingested daily 65 ml of milk-based fruit juice containing either LGG alone (6.5 x 10(9) CFU) or LGG plus 2 g of GOS. Symptom diaries were filled during the study periods. Fecal samples were collected at the beginning and end of both study periods. At the end of both study periods, the amount of bifidobacteria was significantly greater after the ingestion of LGG + GOS compared with LGG alone (geometric mean 9.33 x 10(9) vs. 4.28 x 10(9) CFU/g, p < 0.001). No significant differences were seen in the amount of lactobacilli or LGG, nor did gastrointestinal symptoms, defecation frequency, consistency of stools or ease of defecation differ between the two study periods. Ingestion of LGG combined with 2 g of GOS increased the bifidobacteria more than LGG on its own and thus GOS clearly has a prebiotic effect in children. The children tolerated well a daily intake of 2 g of GOS.\n",

      "PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were randomly assigned at enrollment to receive three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U subcutaneously (SC), followed by either standard weekly epoetin alfa (40K arm) or 120,000 U of epoetin alfa (120K arm) SC every 3 weeks for 18 additional weeks.\n",
      "RESULTS Three hundred sixty-five patients were enrolled. One hundred eighty-three patients were assigned to the 40K arm, and 182 were assigned to the 120K arm. There was no difference in the proportion of patients requiring transfusions during the study (23% in 40K arm and 18% in 120K arm, P = .22) or specifically during the maintenance phase (13% in 40K arm v 15% in 120K arm, P = .58). Patients randomly assigned to the 40K arm were more likely to have a > or = 2 or > or = 3 g/dL hemoglobin (Hb) increment, were more likely to have a drug dose held because of high Hb, and had higher mean end-of-study Hb levels. Toxicities, including thromboembolism, and overall survival were similar. Patients in the 40K arm had a higher global quality of life (QOL) at baseline for unclear reasons, whereas patients in the 120K arm had a greater global QOL improvement during the study, so end-of-study QOL was equivalent.\n",
      "CONCLUSION After three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U, a dose of 120,000 U can be administered safely once every 3 weeks without increasing transfusion needs or sacrificing QOL. The Hb increment is somewhat greater with continued weekly epoetin alfa. Lack of blinding as a result of different treatment schedules may have confounded results.\n",

      "SUMMARY The effect of garlic and onion on alimentary hyperlipemia, induced by feeding 100 g butter, has been studied in 10 healthy subjects. The freshly extracted juice of 50 g of garlic or onion, as well as an equivalent amount of their ether-extracted essential oils, was administered randomly on four different days during a one-week period. Garlic and onion have a significant protective action against fat-induced increases in serum cholesterol and plasma fibrinogen and decreases in coagulation time and fibrinolytic activity. The essential oil fraction, which contains all the taste and odour, exactly duplicated the beneficial effects of whole garlic and onion. It is, therefore, concluded that the active principle of garlic and onion is the essential oil, which chemically is a combination of sulphur-containing compounds, mainly allyl propyl disulphide and diallyl disulphide.\n",

Seventeen patients on chronic digitalis and diuretic therapy were randomized to receive either flosequinan (n = 9) or placebo (n = 8) in a double-blind fashion. Changes in symptomatology, exercise performance, and left ventricular function were assessed serially during the two-month treatment period. During the course of therapy, a modest improvement in the symptom scores and functional classification of the flosequinan-treated patients was observed. Flosequinan evoked a significant increase in maximal exercise capacity. While long-term flosequinan administration also effected a progressive increase in resting heart rate, it did not consistently improve indices of left ventricular systolic function. The addition of chronic vasodilator therapy with flosequinan to standard digitalis-diuretic regimens is capable of inducing clinical improvement in patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure. Trials involving larger patient populations will be necessary to confirm the results of this preliminary study and to determine the extent of clinical improvement, subpopulations benefited, role in heart failure therapeutics, and so forth.\n",

      "Antioxidant supplementation and exercise-induced oxidative stress in the 60-year-old as measured by antipyrine hydroxylates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effects of 12 weeks of antioxidant supplementation on exercise-induced oxidative stress were investigated in older adults (60 (SE 1) years; BMI 26 (SE 1) kg/m(2)). Subjects were randomly divided in two groups: supplementation (n 11) with 100 mg dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, 200 mg ascorbic acid, and 2 mg beta-carotene, and placebo (n 9). Before and after the 12 week supplementation period, subjects cycled for 45 min at submaximal intensity (50 % maximal workload capacity). Antipyrine was used as marker for oxidative stress. Antipyrine reacts quickly with hydroxyl radicals to form para- and ortho-hydroxyantipyrine. The latter metabolite is not formed in man through the mono-oxygenase pathway of cytochrome P450. Daily supplementation significantly increased plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene in the supplemented group (Delta 14.4 (SE 3.2) and 0.4 (se 0.1) micromol/l; P<0.001 and P<0.01). No significant differences, within and between groups, were observed in the exercise-induced increase in the ratios para- and ortho-hydroxyantipyrine to antipyrine. In addition, supplementation did not affect the exercise-induced increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in plasma. In conclusion, in 60-year-old subjects antioxidant supplementation had no effect on the exercise-induced increase in oxidative stress as measured by free radical products of antipyrine.\n",

      "Phase III study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: positive effect on overall and progression-free survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "PURPOSE Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a radiosensitive and chemosensitive tumor. This randomized phase III trial compared concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) versus radiotherapy (RT) alone in patients with advanced NPC.\n",
      "PATIENTS AND METHODS From December 1993 to April 1999, 284 patients with 1992 American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III to IV (M0) NPC were randomly allocated into two arms. Similar dosage and fractionation of RT was administered in both arms. The investigational arm received two cycles of concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin 20 mg/m(2)/d plus fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2)/d by 96-hour continuous infusion during the weeks 1 and 5 of RT. Survival analysis was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test.\n",
      "RESULTS Baseline patient characteristics were comparable in both arms. After a median follow-up of 65 months, 26.2% (37 of 141) and 46.2% (66 of 143) of patients developed tumor relapse in the CCRT and RT-alone groups, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rates were 72.3% for the CCRT arm and 54.2% for the RT-only arm (P =.0022). The 5-year progression-free survival rates were 71.6% for the CCRT group compared with 53.0% for the RT-only group (P =.0012). Although significantly more toxicity was noted in the CCRT arm, including leukopenia and emesis, compliance with the combined treatment was good. The second cycle of concurrent chemotherapy was refused by nine patients and was delayed for > or = 1 week for another nine patients. There were no treatment-related deaths in either arm.\n",
      "CONCLUSION We conclude that CCRT is superior to RT alone for patients with advanced NPC in endemic areas.\n",

      "BACKGROUND The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome (AS): The Junior Detective Training Program. This 7-week program included a computer game, small group sessions, parent training sessions and teacher handouts.\n",
      "METHOD Forty-nine children with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention (n = 26) or wait-list control (n = 23) conditions.\n",
      "RESULTS Relative to children in the wait-list group, program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention, as indicated by parent-report measures. Teacher-report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to post-treatment. Treatment group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management strategies for story characters at post-intervention than at pre-intervention, whereas control participants were not. However, there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body-posture recognition measures. Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post-intervention.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS The Junior Detective Training Program appeared to be effective in enhancing the social skills and emotional understanding of children with AS. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.\n",

      "AIM The study aimed to test simultaneously our understanding of the effects of bupropion sustained-release (SR) treatment on putative mediators and our understanding of determinants of post-quit abstinence, including withdrawal distress, cigarette craving, positive affect and subjective reactions to cigarettes smoked during a lapse. The specificity of bupropion SR effects was also tested in exploratory analyses.\n",
      "DESIGN Data from a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of bupropion SR were submitted to mediation analyses.\n",
      "SETTING Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention, Madison, WI, USA.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS A total of 403 adult, daily smokers without contraindications to bupropion SR use.\n",
      "INTERVENTION Participants were assigned randomly to receive a 9-week course of bupropion SR or placebo pill and to receive eight brief individual counseling sessions or no counseling.\n",
      "MEASUREMENTS Ecological momentary assessment ratings of smoking behavior and putative mediators were collected pre- and post-quit.\n",
      "FINDINGS Results of structural equation and hierarchical linear models did not support the hypothesis that bupropion SR treatment improves short-term abstinence by reducing withdrawal distress or affecting the subjective effects of a lapse cigarette, but provided partial support for mediation by cigarette craving reduction and enhanced positive affect. Bupropion SR effects on point-prevalence abstinence at 1 month post-quit were also mediated partially by enhanced motivation to quit and self-efficacy.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS Results provided some support for models of bupropion SR treatment and relapse and suggested that motivational processes may partially account for bupropion SR efficacy.\n",
